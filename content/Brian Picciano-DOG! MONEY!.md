<p>Officially presenting a collection of original artworks, made by me! This was an
ambitious project I set myself out on this weekend, but I’m really happy to say
that I seem to be completing it on time.</p>

<p>You can check out the collection’s OpenSea page <strong><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/dog-money-exclamation-point">HERE</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Each piece is a tesselating image in SVG format. While it’s pretty easy to just
churn out different combinations of images like this, I decided to keep the
collection small for… artistic integrity? Lack of time? Artificial scarcity??
Who knows how these things are decided.</p>

<p>It was a fun project, to say the least, and even if nothing comes of it
financially it’s nice to have an outlet/portfolio for my art (which usually just
sits in a notebook or git repo somewhere.)</p>"""
