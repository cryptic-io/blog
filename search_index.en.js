– Blog"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-a-simple-rule-for-better-errors/":{"body":"This post will describe a simple rule for writing error messages that I’ve\nbeen using for some time and have found to be worthwhile. Using this rule I can\nbe sure that my errors are propagated upwards with everything needed to debug\nproblems, while not containing tons of extraneous or duplicate information.\nThis rule is not specific to any particular language, pattern of error\npropagation (e.g. exceptions, signals, simple strings), or method of embedding\ninformation in errors (e.g. key/value pairs, formatted strings).\nI do not claim to have invented this system, I’m just describing it.\nThe Rule\nWithout more ado, here’s the rule:\n\n  A function sending back an error should not include information the caller\ncould already know.\n\nPretty simple, really, but the best rules are. Keeping to this rule will result\nin error messages which, once propagated up to their final destination (usually\nsome kind of logger), will contain only the information relevant to the error\nitself, with minimal duplication.\nThe reason this rule works in tandem with good encapsulation of function\nbehavior. The caller of a function knows only the inputs to the function and, in\ngeneral terms, what the function is going to do with those inputs. If the\nreturned error only includes information outside of those two things then the\ncaller knows everything it needs to know about the error, and can continue on to\npropagate that error up the stack (with more information tacked on if necessary)\nor handle it in some other way.\nExamples\n(For examples I’ll use Go, but as previously mentioned this rule will be useful\nin any other language as well.)\nLet’s go through a few examples, to show the various ways that this rule can\nmanifest in actual code.\nExample 1: Nothing to add\nIn this example we have a function which merely wraps a call to io.Copy for\ntwo files:\nfunc copyFile(dst, src *os.File) error {\n\t_, err := io.Copy(dst, src)\n\treturn err\n}\n\nIn this example there’s no need to modify the error from io.Copy before\nreturning it to the caller. What would we even add? The caller already knows\nwhich files were involved in the error, and that the error was encountered\nduring some kind of copy operation (since that’s what the function says it\ndoes), so there’s nothing more to say about it.\nExample 2: Annotating which step an error occurs at\nIn this example we will open a file, read its contents, and return them as a\nstring:\nfunc readFile(path string) (string, error) {\n\tf, err := os.Open(path)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"opening file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n\tdefer f.Close()\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;ReadAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"no\"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Errorf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"reading contents: %w\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"kt\"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"no\"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nIn this example there are two different steps which could result in an error:\nopening the file and reading its contents. If an error is returned then our\nimaginary caller doesn’t know which step the error occurred at. Using our rule\nwe can infer that it would be good to annotate at which step the error is\nfrom, so the caller is able to have a fuller picture of what went wrong.\nNote that each annotation does not include the file path which was passed into\nthe function. The caller already knows this path, so an error being returned\nback which reiterates the path is unnecessary.\nExample 3: Annotating which argument was involved\nIn this example we will read two files using our function from example 2, and\nreturn the concatenation of their contents as a string.\nfunc concatFiles(pathA, pathB string) (string, error) {\n\tcontentsA, err := readFile(pathA)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn \"\", fmt.Errorf(\"reading contents of %q: %w\", pathA, err)\n\t}\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;contentsB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;readFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;pathB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"no\"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Errorf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"reading contents of %q: %w\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;pathB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;contentsA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;contentsB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"no\"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nLike in example 2 we annotate each error, but instead of annotating the action\nwe annotate which file path was involved in each error. This is because if we\nsimply annotated with the string reading contents like before it wouldn’t be\nclear to the caller which file’s contents couldn’t be read. Therefore we\ninclude which path the error is relevant to.\nExample 4: Layering\nIn this example we will show how using this rule habitually results in easy to\nread errors which contain all relevant information surrounding the error. Our\nexample reads one file, the “full” file, using our readFile function from\nexample 2. It then reads the concatenation of two files, the “split” files,\nusing our concatFiles function from example 3. It finally determines if the\ntwo strings are equal:\nfunc verifySplits(fullFilePath, splitFilePathA, splitFilePathB string) error {\n\tfullContents, err := readFile(fullFilePath)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn fmt.Errorf(\"reading contents of full file: %w\", err)\n\t}\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;splitContents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;concatFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;splitFilePathA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;splitFilePathB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"no\"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Errorf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"reading concatenation of split files: %w\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;fullContents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;splitContents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;New&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"full file's contents do not match the split files' contents\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"no\"&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nAs previously, we don’t annotate the file paths for the different possible\nerrors, but instead say which files were involved. The caller already knows\nthe paths, there’s no need to reiterate them if there’s another way of referring\nto them.\nLet’s see what our errors actually look like! We run our new function using the\nfollowing:\n\terr := verifySplits(\"full.txt\", \"splitA.txt\", \"splitB.txt\")\n\tfmt.Println(err)\n\nLet’s say full.txt doesn’t exist, we’ll get the following error:\nreading contents of full file: opening file: open full.txt: no such file or directory\n\nThe error is simple, and gives you everything you need to understand what went\nwrong: while attempting to read the full file, during the opening of that file,\nour code found that there was no such file. In fact, the error returned by\nos.Open contains the name of the file, which goes against our rule, but it’s\nthe standard library so what can ya do?\nNow, let’s say that splitA.txt doesn’t exist, then we’ll get this error:\nreading concatenation of split files: reading contents of \"splitA.txt\": opening file: open splitA.txt: no such file or directory\n\nNow we did include the file path here, and so the standard library’s failure to\nfollow our rule is causing us some repitition. But overall, within the parts of\nthe error we have control over, the error is concise and gives you everything\nyou need to know what happened.\nExceptions\nAs with all rules, there are certainly exceptions. The primary one I’ve found is\nthat certain helper functions can benefit from bending this rule a bit. For\nexample, if there is a helper function which is called to verify some kind of\nuser input in many places, it can be helpful to include that input value within\nthe error returned from the helper function:\nfunc verifyInput(str string) error {\n    if err := check(str); err != nil {\n        return fmt.Errorf(\"input %q was bad: %w\", str, err)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nstr is known to the caller so, according to our rule, we don’t need to include\nit in the error. But if you’re going to end up wrapping the error returned from\nverifyInput with str at every call site anyway it can be convenient to save\nsome energy and break the rule. It’s a trade-off, convenience in exchange for\nconsistency.\nAnother exception might be made with regards to stack traces.\nIn the set of examples given above I tended to annotate each error being\nreturned with a description of where in the function the error was being\nreturned from. If your language automatically includes some kind of stack trace\nwith every error, and if you find that you are generally able to reconcile that\nstack trace with actual code, then it may be that annotating each error site is\nunnecessary, except when annotating actual runtime values (e.g. an input\nstring).\nAs in all things with programming, there are no hard rules; everything is up to\ninterpretation and the specific use-case being worked on. That said, I hope what\nI’ve laid out here will prove generally useful to you, in whatever way you might\ntry to use it.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-a-simple-rule-for-better-errors/","title":"A Simple Rule for Better Errors"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-building-gomobile-using-nix/":{"body":"When I last left off with the nebula project I wanted to nix-ify the\nbuild process for Cryptic’s mobile_nebula fork. While I’ve made\nprogress on the overall build, one particular bit of it really held me up, so\nI’m writing about that part here. I’ll finish the full build at a later time.\ngomobile\ngomobile is a toolkit for the go programming language to allow for\nrunning go code on Android and iOS devices. mobile_nebula uses gomobile to\nbuild a simple wrapper around the nebula client that the mobile app can then\nhook into.\nThis means that in order to nix-ify the entire mobile_nebula project I first\nneed to nix-ify gomobile, and since there isn’t (at time of writing) an\nexisting package for gomobile in the nixpkgs repo, I had to roll my own.\nI started with a simple buildGoModule nix expression:\npkgs.buildGoModule {\n    pname = \"gomobile\";\n    version = \"unstable-2020-12-17\";\n    src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {\n        owner = \"golang\";\n        repo = \"mobile\";\n        rev = \"e6ae53a27f4fd7cfa2943f2ae47b96cba8eb01c9\";\n        sha256 = \"03dzis3xkj0abcm4k95w2zd4l9ygn0rhkj56bzxbcpwa7idqhd62\";\n    };\n    vendorSha256 = \"1n1338vqkc1n8cy94501n7jn3qbr28q9d9zxnq2b4rxsqjfc9l94\";\n}\n\nThe basic idea here is that buildGoModule will acquire a specific revision of\nthe gomobile source code from github, then attempt to build it. However,\ngomobile is a special beast in that it requires a number of C/C++ libraries in\norder to be built. I discovered this upon running this expression, when I\nreceived this error:\n./work.h:12:10: fatal error: GLES3/gl3.h: No such file or directory\n   12 | #include &lt;GLES3/gl3.h&gt; // install on Ubuntu with: sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libx11-dev\n\nThis stumped me for a bit, as I couldn’t figure out a) the “right” place to\nsource the GLES3 header file from, and b) how to properly hook that into the\nbuildGoModule expression. My initial attempts involved trying to include\nversions of the header file from my androidsdk nix package which I had already\ngotten (mostly) working, but the version which ships there appears to expect to\nbe using clang. cgo (go’s compiler which is used for C/C++ interop) only\nsupports gcc, so that strategy failed.\nI didn’t like having to import the header file from androidsdk anyway, as it\nmeant that my gomobile would only work within the context of the\nmobile_nebula project, rather than being a standalone utility.\nnix-index\nAt this point I flailed around some more trying to figure out where to get this\nheader file from. Eventually I stumbled on the nix-index project,\nwhich implements something similar to the locate utility on linux: you give it\na file pattern, and it searches your active nix channels for any packages which\nprovide a file matching that pattern.\nSince nix is amazing it’s not actually necessary to install nix-index, I\nsimply start up a shell with the package available using nix-shell -p\nnix-index. On first run I needed to populate the index by running the\nnix-index command, which took some time, but after that finding packages which\nprovide the file I need is as easy as:\n&gt; nix-shell -p nix-index\n[nix-shell:/tmp]$ nix-locate GLES3/gl3.h\n(zulip.out)                                      82,674 r /nix/store/wbfw7w2ixdp317wip77d4ji834v1k1b9-libglvnd-1.3.2-dev/include/GLES3/gl3.h\nlibglvnd.dev                                     82,674 r /nix/store/pghxzmnmxdcarg5bj3js9csz0h85g08m-libglvnd-1.3.2-dev/include/GLES3/gl3.h\nemscripten.out                                   82,666 r /nix/store/x3c4y2h5rn1jawybk48r6glzs1jl029s-emscripten-2.0.1/share/emscripten/system/include/GLES3/gl3.h\n\nSo my mystery file is provided by a few packages, but libglvnd.dev stood out\nto me as it’s also the pacman package which provides the same file in my real\noperating system:\n&gt; yay -Qo /usr/include/GLES3/gl3.h\n/usr/include/GLES3/gl3.h is owned by libglvnd 1.3.2-1\n\nThis gave me some confidence that this was the right track.\ncgo\nMy next fight was with cgo itself. Go’s build process provides a few different\nentry points for C/C++ compiler/linker flags, including both environment\nvariables and command-line arguments. But I wasn’t using go build directly,\ninstead I was working through nix’s buildGoModule wrapper. This added a huge\nlayer of confusion as all of nixpkgs is pretty terribly documented, so you\nreally have to just divine behavior from the source\n(good luck).\nAfter lots of debugging (hint: NIX_DEBUG=1) I determined that all which is\nactually needed is to set the CGO_CFLAGS variable within the buildGoModule\narguments. This would translate to the CGO_CFLAGS environment variable being\nset during all internal commands, and whatever go build commands get used\nwould pick up my compiler flags from that.\nMy new nix expression looked like this:\npkgs.buildGoModule {\n    pname = \"gomobile\";\n    version = \"unstable-2020-12-17\";\n    src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {\n        owner = \"golang\";\n        repo = \"mobile\";\n        rev = \"e6ae53a27f4fd7cfa2943f2ae47b96cba8eb01c9\";\n        sha256 = \"03dzis3xkj0abcm4k95w2zd4l9ygn0rhkj56bzxbcpwa7idqhd62\";\n    };\n    vendorSha256 = \"1n1338vqkc1n8cy94501n7jn3qbr28q9d9zxnq2b4rxsqjfc9l94\";\nCGO_CFLAGS = [\n    \"-I ${pkgs.libglvnd.dev}/include\"\n];\n\n}\n\nRunning this produced a new error. Progress! The new error was:\n/nix/store/p792j5f44l3f0xi7ai5jllwnxqwnka88-binutils-2.31.1/bin/ld: cannot find -lGLESv2\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\n\nSo pretty similar to the previous issue, but this time the linker wasn’t finding\na library file rather than the compiler not finding a header file. Once again I\nused nix-index’s nix-locate command to find that this library file is\nprovided by the libglvnd package (as opposed to libglvnd.dev, which provided\nthe header file).\nAdding libglvnd to the CGO_CFLAGS did not work, as it turns out that flags\nfor the linker cgo uses get passed in via CGO_LDFLAGS (makes sense). After\nadding this new variable I got yet another error; this time X11/Xlib.h was not\nable to be found. I repeated the process of nix-locate/add to CGO_*FLAGS a\nfew more times until all dependencies were accounted for. The new nix expression\nlooked like this:\npkgs.buildGoModule {\n    pname = \"gomobile\";\n    version = \"unstable-2020-12-17\";\n    src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {\n        owner = \"golang\";\n        repo = \"mobile\";\n        rev = \"e6ae53a27f4fd7cfa2943f2ae47b96cba8eb01c9\";\n        sha256 = \"03dzis3xkj0abcm4k95w2zd4l9ygn0rhkj56bzxbcpwa7idqhd62\";\n    };\n    vendorSha256 = \"1n1338vqkc1n8cy94501n7jn3qbr28q9d9zxnq2b4rxsqjfc9l94\";\nCGO_CFLAGS = [\n    \"-I ${pkgs.libglvnd.dev}/include\"\n    \"-I ${pkgs.xlibs.libX11.dev}/include\"\n    \"-I ${pkgs.xlibs.xorgproto}/include\"\n    \"-I ${pkgs.openal}/include\"\n];\n\nCGO_LDFLAGS = [\n    \"-L ${pkgs.libglvnd}/lib\"\n    \"-L ${pkgs.xlibs.libX11}/lib\"\n    \"-L ${pkgs.openal}/lib\"\n];\n\n}\n\nTests\nThe CGO_*FLAGS variables took care of all compiler/linker errors, but there\nwas one issue left: buildGoModule apparently runs the project’s tests after\nthe build phase. gomobile’s tests were actually mostly passing, but some\nfailed due to trying to copy files around, which nix was having none of. After\nsome more buildGoModule source divination I found that\nif I passed an empty checkPhase argument it would skip the check phase, and\ntherefore skip running these tests.\nFin!\nThe final nix expression looks like so:\npkgs.buildGoModule {\n    pname = \"gomobile\";\n    version = \"unstable-2020-12-17\";\n    src = pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {\n        owner = \"golang\";\n        repo = \"mobile\";\n        rev = \"e6ae53a27f4fd7cfa2943f2ae47b96cba8eb01c9\";\n        sha256 = \"03dzis3xkj0abcm4k95w2zd4l9ygn0rhkj56bzxbcpwa7idqhd62\";\n    };\n    vendorSha256 = \"1n1338vqkc1n8cy94501n7jn3qbr28q9d9zxnq2b4rxsqjfc9l94\";\nCGO_CFLAGS = [\n    \"-I ${pkgs.libglvnd.dev}/include\"\n    \"-I ${pkgs.xlibs.libX11.dev}/include\"\n    \"-I ${pkgs.xlibs.xorgproto}/include\"\n    \"-I ${pkgs.openal}/include\"\n];\n\nCGO_LDFLAGS = [\n    \"-L ${pkgs.libglvnd}/lib\"\n    \"-L ${pkgs.xlibs.libX11}/lib\"\n    \"-L ${pkgs.openal}/lib\"\n];\n\ncheckPhase = \"\";\n\n}\n\nOnce I complete the nix-ification of mobile_nebula I’ll submit a PR to the\nnixpkgs upstream with this, so that others can have gomobile available as\nwell!\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-building-gomobile-using-nix/","title":"Building gomobile Using Nix"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-building-mobile-nebula/":{"body":"This post is going to be cheating a bit. I want to start working on adding DNS\nresolver configuration to the mobile nebula app (if you don’t\nknow nebula, check it out, it’s well worth knowing about), but I also\nneed to write a blog post for this week, so I’m combining the two exercises.\nThis post will essentially be my notes from my progress on today’s task.\n(Protip: listen to this while following along to achieve the proper\nopen-source programming aesthetic.)\nThe current mobile nebula app works very well, but it is lacking one major\nfeature: the ability to specify custom DNS resolvers. This is important because\nI want to be able to access resources on my nebula network by their hostname,\nnot their IP. Android does everything in its power to make DNS configuration\nimpossible, and essentially the only way to actually accomplish this is by\nspecifying the DNS resolvers within the app. I go into more details about why\nAndroid is broken here.\nSetup\nBefore I can make changes to the app I need to make sure I can correctly build\nit in the first place, so that’s the major task for today. The first step to\ndoing so is to install the project’s dependencies. As described in the\nmobile_nebula README, the dependencies are:\n\n  flutter\n  gomobile\n  android-studio\n  Enable NDK\n\nIt should be noted that as of writing I haven’t used any of these tools ever,\nand have only done a small amount of android programming, probably 7 or 8 years\nago, so I’m going to have to walk the line between figuring out problems on the\nfly and not having to completely learning these entire ecosystems; there’s only\nso many hours in a weekend, after all.\nI’m running Archlinux so I install android-studio and flutter by\ndoing:\nyay -Sy android-studio flutter\n\nAnd I install gomobile, according to its documentation via:\ngo get golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile\ngomobile init\n\nNow I startup android-studio and go through the setup wizard for it. I choose\nstandard setup because customized setup doesn’t actually offer any interesting\noptions. Next android-studio spends approximately two lifetimes downloading\ndependencies while my eyesight goes blurry because I’m drinking my coffee too\nfast.\nIt’s annoying that I need to install these dependencies, especially\nandroid-studio, in order to build this project. A future goal of mine is to nix\nthis whole thing up, and make a build pipeline where you can provide a full\nnebula configuration file and it outputs a custom APK file for that specific\nconfig; zero configuration required at runtime. This will be useful for\nlazy/non-technical users who want to be part of the nebula network.\nOnce android-studio starts up I’m not quite done yet: there’s still the NDK\nwhich must be enabled. The instructions given by the link in\nmobile_nebula’s README explain doing this pretty well, but it’s\nimportant to install the specific version indicated in the mobile_nebula repo\n(21.0.6113669 at time of writing). Only another 1GB of dependency downloading\nto go….\nWhile waiting for the NDK to download I run flutter doctor to make sure\nflutter is working, and it gives me some permissions errors. This blog\npost gives some tips on setting up, and after running the\nfollowing…\nsudo groupadd flutterusers\nsudo gpasswd -a $USER flutterusers\nsudo chown -R :flutterusers /opt/flutter\nsudo chmod -R g+w /opt/flutter/\nnewgrp flutterusers\n\n… I’m able to run flutter doctor. It gives the following output:\n[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 1.22.6, on Linux, locale en_US.UTF-8)\n[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 30.0.3)\n✗ Android licenses not accepted.  To resolve this, run: flutter doctor --android-licenses\n[!] Android Studio\n✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.\n✗ Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.\n[!] Connected device\n! No devices available\n! Doctor found issues in 3 categories.\n\nThe first issue is easily solved as per the instructions given. The second is\nsolved by finding the plugin manager in android-studio and installing the\nflutter plugin (which installs the dart plugin as a dependency, we call that a\ntwofer).\nAfter installing the plugin the doctor command still complains about not finding\nthe plugins, but the above mentioned blog post indicates to me that this is\nexpected. It’s comforting to know that the problems indicated by the doctor may\nor may not be real problems.\nThe blog post also indicates that I need openjdk-8 installed,\nso I do:\nyay -S jdk8-openjdk\n\nAnd use the archlinux-java command to confirm that that is indeed the default\nversion for my shell. The mobile_nebula helpfully expects an\nenv.sh file to exist in the root, so if openjdk-8 wasn’t already the default I\ncould make it so within that file.\nBuild\nAt this point I think I’m ready to try actually building an APK. Thoughts and\nprayers required. I run the following in a terminal, since for some reason the\nBuild &gt; Flutter &gt; Build APK dropdown button in android-studio did nothing.\nflutter build apk\n\nIt takes quite a while to run, but in the end it errors with:\nmake: 'mobileNebula.aar' is up to date.\ncp: cannot create regular file '../android/app/src/main/libs/mobileNebula.aar': No such file or directory\nFAILURE: Build failed with an exception.\n\n\nWhere:\nBuild file '/tmp/src/mobile_nebula/android/app/build.gradle' line: 95\n\n\nWhat went wrong:\nA problem occurred evaluating project ':app'.\n&gt; Process 'command './gen-artifacts.sh'' finished with non-zero exit value 1\n\n\nTry:\nRun with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.

Done                         1.7s\nGradle task bundleRelease failed with exit code 1\n\nI narrow down the problem to the ./gen-artifacts.sh script in the repo’s root,\nwhich takes in either android or ios as an argument. Running it directly\nas ./gen-artifacts.sh android results in the same error:\nmake: 'mobileNebula.aar' is up to date.\ncp: cannot create regular file '../android/app/src/main/libs/mobileNebula.aar': No such file or directory\n\nSo now I gotta figure out wtf that mobileNebula.aar file is. The first thing I\nnote is that not only is that file not there, but the libs directory it’s\nsupposed to be present in is also not there. So I suspect that there’s a missing\nbuild step somewhere.\nI search for the string mobileNebula.aar within the project using\nag and find that it’s built by nebula/Makefile as follows:\nmobileNebula.aar: *.go\n\tgomobile bind -trimpath -v --target=android\n\nSo that file is made by gomobile, good to know! Additionally the file is\nactually there in the nebula directory, so I suspect there’s just a missing\nbuild step to move it into android/app/src/main/libs. Via some more ag-ing I\nfind that the code which is supposed to move the mobileNebula.aar file is in\nthe gen-artifacts.sh script, but that script doesn’t create the libs folder\nas it ought to. I apply the following diff:\ndiff --git a/gen-artifacts.sh b/gen-artifacts.sh\nindex 601ed7b..4f73b4c 100755\n--- a/gen-artifacts.sh\n\\u002B\\u002B\\u002B b/gen-artifacts.sh\n@@ -16,7 +16,7 @@ if [ \"$1\" = \"ios\" ]; then\n elif [ \"$1\" = \"android\" ]; then\n   # Build nebula for android\n   make mobileNebula.aar\n-  rm -rf ../android/app/src/main/libs/mobileNebula.aar\n+  mkdir -p ../android/app/src/main/libs\n   cp mobileNebula.aar ../android/app/src/main/libs/mobileNebula.aar\nelse\n\n(The rm -rf isn’t necessary, since a) that file is about to be overwritten by\nthe subsequent cp whether or not it’s there, and b) it’s just deleting a\nsingle file so the -rf is an unnecessary risk).\nAt this point I re-run flutter build apk and receive a new error.

Big ones and small ones!\nAt this point I’m a bit fed up, and want to try a completely fresh build. I back\nup my modified env.sh and gen-artifacts.sh files, delete the mobile_nebula\nrepo, re-clone it, reinstall those files, and try building again.

Well, probably not. It seems that while\nbuild/app/intermediates/flutter/debug/libs.jar indeed doesn’t exist in the\nrepo, build/app/intermediates/flutter/release/libs.jar does, so this appears\nto possibly be an issue in declaring which build environment is being used.\nAfter some googling I found this flutter issue related to the\nerror.

There’s some\npre-existing networks already installed, which isn’t the case for the Play Store\nversion as far as I can remember, so I suspect those are only there in the\ndebugging build. Unfortunately the presence of these test networks causes the\napp the throw a bunch of errors because it can’t contact those networks. Oh well.\nThe presence of those test networks, in a way, is actually a good thing, as it\nmeans there’s probably already a starting point for what I want to do: building\na per-device nebula app with a config preloaded into it.\nFurther Steps\nBeyond continuing on towards my actual goal of adding DNS resolvers to this app,\nthere’s a couple of other paths I could potentially go down at this point.\n\n  \n    As mentioned, nixify the whole thing. I’m 99% sure the android-studio GUI\nisn’t actually needed at all, and I only used it for installing the CMake and\nNDK plugins because I didn’t bother to look up how to do it on the CLI.\n  \n  \n    Figuring out how to do a proper release build would be great, just for my own\neducation. Based on the flutter issue it’s possible that all\nthat’s needed is to downgrade gradle, but maybe that’s not so easy.\n  \n  \n    Get an android emulator working so that I don’t have to install to my phone\neverytime I want to test the app out. I’m not sure if that will also work for\nthe VPN aspect of the app, but it will at least help me iterate on UI changes\nfaster.\n  \n\nBut at this point I’m done for the day, I’ll continue on this project some other\ntime.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-building-mobile-nebula/","title":"Building Mobile Nebula"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-component-oriented-programming/":{"body":"A previous post in this\nblog focused on a\nframework developed to make designing component-based programs easier. In\nretrospect, the proposed pattern/framework was over-engineered. This post\nattempts to present the same ideas in a more distilled form, as a simple\nprogramming pattern and without the unnecessary framework.\nComponents\nMany languages, libraries, and patterns make use of a concept called a\n“component,” but in each case the meaning of “component” might be slightly\ndifferent. Therefore, to begin talking about components, it is necessary to first\ndescribe what is meant by “component” in this post.\nFor the purposes of this post, the properties of components include the\nfollowing.\n&nbsp;1… Abstract: A component is an interface consisting of one or more\nmethods.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1a… A function might be considered a single-method component\nif the language supports first-class functions.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1b… A component, being an interface, may have one or more\nimplementations. Generally, there will be a primary implementation, which is\nused during a program’s runtime, and secondary “mock” implementations, which are\nonly used when testing other components.\n&nbsp;2… Instantiatable: An instance of a component, given some set of\nparameters, can be instantiated as a standalone entity. More than one of the\nsame component can be instantiated, as needed.\n&nbsp;3… Composable: A component may be used as a parameter of another\ncomponent’s instantiation. This would make it a child component of the one being\ninstantiated (the parent).\n&nbsp;4… Pure: A component may not use mutable global variables (i.e.,\nsingletons) or impure global functions (e.g., system calls). It may only use\nconstants and variables/components given to it during instantiation.\n&nbsp;5… Ephemeral: A component may have a specific method used to clean\nup all resources that it’s holding (e.g., network connections, file handles,\nlanguage-specific lightweight threads, etc.).\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5a… This cleanup method should not clean up any child\ncomponents given as instantiation parameters.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5b… This cleanup method should not return until the\ncomponent’s cleanup is complete.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5c… A component should not be cleaned up until all its\nparent components are cleaned up.\nComponents are composed together to create component-oriented programs. This is\ndone by passing components as parameters to other components during\ninstantiation. The main procedure of the program is responsible for\ninstantiating and composing the components of the program.\nExample\nIt’s easier to show than to tell. This section posits a simple program and then\ndescribes how it would be implemented in a component-oriented way. The program\nchooses a random number and exposes an HTTP interface that allows users to try\nand guess that number. The following are requirements of the program:\n\n  \n    A guess consists of a name that identifies the user performing the guess and\nthe number that is being guessed;\n  \n  \n    A score is kept for each user who has performed a guess;\n  \n  \n    Upon an incorrect guess, the user should be informed of whether they guessed\ntoo high or too low, and 1 point should be deducted from their score;\n  \n  \n    Upon a correct guess, the program should pick a new random number against\nwhich to check subsequent guesses, and 1000 points should be added to the\nuser’s score;\n  \n  \n    The HTTP interface should have two endpoints: one for users to submit guesses,\nand another that lists out user scores from highest to lowest;\n  \n  \n    Scores should be saved to disk so they survive program restarts.\n  \n\nIt seems clear that there will be two major areas of functionality for our\nprogram: score-keeping and user interaction via HTTP. Each of these can be\nencapsulated into components called scoreboard and httpHandlers,\nrespectively.\nscoreboard will need to interact with a filesystem component to save/restore\nscores (because it can’t use system calls directly; see property 4). It would be\nwasteful for scoreboard to save the scores to disk on every score update, so\ninstead it will do so every 5 seconds. A time component will be required to\nsupport this.\nhttpHandlers will be choosing the random number which is being guessed, and\nwill therefore need a component that produces random numbers. httpHandlers\nwill also be recording score changes to scoreboard, so it will need access to\nscoreboard.\nThe example implementation will be written in go, which makes differentiating\nHTTP handler functionality from the actual HTTP server quite easy; thus, there\nwill be an httpServer component that uses httpHandlers.\nFinally, a logger component will be used in various places to log useful\ninformation during runtime.\nThe example implementation can be found\nhere. While most of it can be\nskimmed, it is recommended to at least read through the main function to see\nhow components are composed together. Note that main is where all components\nare instantiated, and that all components’ take in their child components as\npart of their instantiation.\nDAG\nOne way to look at a component-oriented program is as a directed acyclic graph\n(DAG), where each node in the graph represents a component, and each edge\nindicates that one component depends upon another component for instantiation.\nFor the previous program, it’s quite easy to construct such a DAG just by\nlooking at main, as in the following:\nnet.Listener     rand.Rand        os.File\n     ^               ^               ^\n     |               |               |\n httpServer --&gt; httpHandlers --&gt; scoreboard --&gt; time.Ticker\n     |               |               |\n     +---------------+---------------+--&gt; log.Logger\n\nNote that all the leaves of the DAG (i.e., nodes with no children) describe the\npoints where the program meets the operating system via system calls. The leaves\nare, in essence, the program’s interface with the outside world.\nWhile it’s not necessary to actually draw out the DAG for every program one\nwrites, it can be helpful to at least think about the program’s structure in\nthese terms.\nBenefits\nLooking at the previous example implementation, one would be forgiven for having\nthe immediate reaction of “This seems like a lot of extra work for little gain.\nWhy can’t I just make the system calls where I need to, and not bother with\nwrapping them in interfaces and all these other rules?”\nThe following sections will answer that concern by showing the benefits gained\nby following a component-oriented pattern.\nTesting\nTesting is important, that much is being assumed.\nA distinction to be made with testing is between unit and non-unit tests. Unit\ntests are those for which there are no requirements for the environment outside\nthe test, such as the existence of global variables, running databases,\nfilesystems, or network services. Unit tests do not interact with the world\noutside the testing procedure, but instead use mocks in place of the\nfunctionality that would be expected by that world.\nUnit tests are important because they are faster to run and more consistent than\nnon-unit tests. Unit tests also force the programmer to consider different\npossible states of a component’s dependencies during the mocking process.\nUnit tests are often not employed by programmers, because they are difficult to\nimplement for code that does not expose any way to swap out dependencies for\nmocks of those dependencies. The primary culprit of this difficulty is the\ndirect usage of singletons and impure global functions. For component-oriented\nprograms, all components inherently allow for the swapping out of any\ndependencies via their instantiation parameters, so there’s no extra effort\nneeded to support unit tests.\nTests for the example implementation can be found\nhere. Note that all\ndependencies of each component being tested are mocked/stubbed next to them.\nConfiguration\nPractically all programs require some level of runtime configuration. This may\ntake the form of command-line arguments, environment variables, configuration\nfiles, etc.\nFor a component-oriented program, all components are instantiated in the same\nplace, main, so it’s very easy to expose any arbitrary parameter to the user\nvia configuration. For any component that is affected by a configurable\nparameter, that component merely needs to take an instantiation parameter for\nthat configurable parameter; main can connect the two together. This accounts\nfor the unit testing of a component with different configurations, while still\nallowing for the configuration of any arbitrary internal functionality.\nFor more complex configuration systems, it is also possible to implement a\nconfiguration component that wraps whatever configuration-related\nfunctionality is needed, which other components use as a sub-component. The\neffect is the same.\nTo demonstrate how configuration works in a component-oriented program, the\nexample program’s requirements will be augmented to include the following:\n\n  \n    The point change values for both correct and incorrect guesses (currently\nhardcoded at 1000 and 1, respectively) should be configurable on the\ncommand-line;\n  \n  \n    The save file’s path, HTTP listen address, and save interval should all be\nconfigurable on the command-line.\n  \n\nThe new implementation, with newly configurable parameters, can be found\nhere. Most of the program has\nremained the same, and all unit tests from before remain valid. The primary\ndifference is that scoreboard takes in two new parameters for the point change\nvalues, and configuration is set up inside main using the flags package.\nSetup/Runtime/Cleanup\nA program can be split into three stages: setup, runtime, and cleanup. Setup is\nthe stage during which the internal state is assembled to make runtime possible.\nRuntime is the stage during which a program’s actual function is being\nperformed. Cleanup is the stage during which the runtime stops and internal\nstate is disassembled.\nA graceful (i.e., reliably correct) setup is quite natural to accomplish for\nmost. On the other hand, a graceful cleanup is, unfortunately, not a programmer’s\nfirst concern (if it is a concern at all).\nWhen building reliable and correct programs, a graceful cleanup is as important\nas a graceful setup and runtime. A program is still running while it is being\ncleaned up, and it’s possibly still acting on the outside world. Shouldn’t\nit behave correctly during that time?\nAchieving a graceful setup and cleanup with components is quite simple.\nDuring setup, a single-threaded procedure (main) first constructs the leaf\ncomponents, then the components that take those leaves as parameters, then the\ncomponents that take those as parameters, and so on, until the component DAG\nis fully constructed.\nAt this point, the program’s runtime has begun.\nOnce the runtime is over, signified by a process signal or some other mechanism,\nit’s only necessary to call each component’s cleanup method (if any; see\nproperty 5) in the reverse of the order in which the components were\ninstantiated.  This order is inherently deterministic, as the components were\ninstantiated by a single-threaded procedure.\nInherent to this pattern is the fact that each component will certainly be\ncleaned up before any of its child components, as its child components must have\nbeen instantiated first, and a component will not clean up child components\ngiven as parameters (properties 5a and 5c). Therefore, the pattern avoids\nuse-after-cleanup situations.\nTo demonstrate a graceful cleanup in a component-oriented program, the example\nprogram’s requirements will be augmented to include the following:\n\n  \n    The program will terminate itself upon an interrupt signal;\n  \n  \n    During termination (cleanup), the program will save the latest set of scores\nto disk one final time.\n  \n\nThe new implementation that accounts for these new requirements can be found\nhere. For this example, go’s\ndefer feature could have been used instead, which would have been even\ncleaner, but was omitted for the sake of those using other languages.\nConclusion\nThe component pattern helps make programs more reliable with only a small amount\nof extra effort incurred. In fact, most of the pattern has to do with\nestablishing sensible abstractions around global functionality and remembering\ncertain idioms for how those abstractions should be composed together, something\nmost of us already do to some extent anyway.\nWhile beneficial in many ways, component-oriented programming is merely a tool\nthat can be applied in many cases. It is certain that there are cases where it\nis not the right tool for the job, so apply it deliberately and intelligently.\nCriticisms/Questions\nIn lieu of a FAQ, I will attempt to premeditate questions and criticisms of the\ncomponent-oriented programming pattern laid out in this post.\nThis seems like a lot of extra work.\nBuilding reliable programs is a lot of work, just as building a\nreliable anything is a lot of work. Many of us work in an industry that likes\nto balance reliability (sometimes referred to by the more specious “quality”)\nwith malleability and deliverability, which naturally leads to skepticism of any\nsuggestions requiring more time spent on reliability. This is not necessarily a\nbad thing, it’s just how the industry functions.\nAll that said, a pattern need not be followed perfectly to be worthwhile, and\nthe amount of extra work incurred by it can be decided based on practical\nconsiderations. I merely maintain that code which is (mostly) component-oriented\nis easier to maintain in the long run, even if it might be harder to get off the\nground initially.\nMy language makes this difficult.\nI don’t know of any language which makes this pattern particularly easier than\nothers, so, unfortunately, we’re all in the same boat to some extent (though I\nrecognize that some languages, or their ecosystems, make it more difficult than\nothers). It seems to me that this pattern shouldn’t be unbearably difficult for\nanyone to implement in any language either, however, as the only language\nfeature required is abstract typing.\nIt would be nice to one day see a language that explicitly supports this\npattern by baking the component properties in as compiler-checked rules.\nMy main is too big\nThere’s no law saying all component construction needs to happen in main,\nthat’s just the most sensible place for it. If there are large sections of your\nprogram that are independent of each other, then they could each have their own\nconstruction functions that main then calls.\nOther questions that are worth asking include: Can my program be split up\ninto multiple programs? Can the responsibilities of any of my components be\nrefactored to reduce the overall complexity of the component DAG? Can the\ninstantiation of any components be moved within their parent’s\ninstantiation function?\n(This last suggestion may seem to be disallowed, but is fine as long as the\nparent’s instantiation function remains pure.)\nWon’t this will result in over-abstraction?\nAbstraction is a necessary tool in a programmer’s toolkit, there is simply no\nway around it. The only questions are “how much?” and “where?”\nThe use of this pattern does not affect how those questions are answered, in my\nopinion, but instead aims to more clearly delineate the relationships and\ninteractions between the different abstracted types once they’ve been\nestablished using other methods. Over-abstraction is possible and avoidable\nregardless of which language, pattern, or framework is being used.\nDoes CoP conflict with object-oriented or functional programming?\nI don’t think so. OoP languages will have abstract types as part of their core\nfeature-set; most difficulties are going to be with deliberately not using\nother features of an OoP language, and with imported libraries in the language\nperhaps making life inconvenient by not following CoP (specifically regarding\ncleanup and the use of singletons).\nFor functional programming, it may well be that, depending on the language, CoP\nis technically being used, as functional languages are already generally\nantagonistic toward globals and impure functions, which is most of the battle.\nIf anything, the transition from functional to component-oriented programming\nwill generally be an organizational task.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-component-oriented-programming/","title":"Component-Oriented Programming"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-conditionals-in-ginger-errata/":{"body":"After publishing the last post in the series I walked away from my computer\nfeeling that I was very clever and had made a good post. This was incorrect.\nTo summarize the previous post, it’s not obvious which is the best way\nto structure conditionals in a graphical programming language. My favorite\nsolution looked something like this:\n       in -&gt; } -&gt; } -if-&gt; } -0-&gt; } -add-&gt; out\nin -1-&gt; } -&gt; }    }       } -1-&gt; } -sub-&gt; out\nin -0-&gt; }         }\n                  }\n         in -lt-&gt; }\n\nEssentially an if operator which accepts a value and a boolean, and which has\ntwo output edges. If the boolean is true then the input value is sent along the\nfirst output edge, and if it’s false it’s sent along the second.\nThis structure is not possible, given the properties of ginger graphs that have\nbeen laid out in other posts in the series.\nNodes, Tuples, and Edges\nA ginger graph, as it has been presented so far, is composed of these three\nelements. A node has a value, and its value is unique to the graph; if two nodes\nhave the same value then they are the same node. Edges connect two nodes or\ntuples together, and have a value and direction. Tuples are, in essence, a node\nwhose value is its input edges.\nThe if operation above lies on an edge, not a node or tuple. It cannot have\nmultiple output edges, since it cannot have any edges at all. It is an edge.\nSo it’s back to the drawing board, to some extent. But luckily I’ve got some\nmore ideas in my back pocket.\nForks and Junctions\nIn an older conception of ginger there was no tuple, but instead there were\nforks and junctions. A junction was essentially the same as a tuple, just named\ndifferently: a node whose value is its input edges. A fork was just the\nopposite, a node whose value is its output edges. Junctions and forks naturally\ncomplimented each other, but ultimately I didn’t find forks to be useful for\nmuch because there weren’t cases where it was necessary to have a single edge be\nsplit across multiple output edges directly; any case which appeared to require\na fork could be satisfied by directing the edge into a 1-tuple and using the\noutput edges of the 1-tuple.\nBut now we have such a case. The 1-tuple won’t work, because the if operator\nwould only see the 1-tuple, not its edges. It could be supposed that the graph\ninterpreter could say that an if operation must be followed by a 1-tuple, and\nthat the 1-tuple’s output edges have a special meaning in that circumstance. But\nmaking the output edges of a 1-tuple have different meaning in different\ncircumstances isn’t very elegant.\nSo a fork might be just the thing here. For the example I will represent a\nfork as the opposite of a tuple: a vertical column of { characters.\n       in -&gt; } -&gt; } -if-&gt; { -0-&gt; } -add-&gt; out\nin -1-&gt; } -&gt; }    }       { -1-&gt; } -sub-&gt; out\nin -0-&gt; }         }\n                  }\n         in -lt-&gt; }\n\nIt looks elegant, which is nice. I am curious though if there’s any other\npossible use-case where a fork might be useful… if there’s not then it seems\nodd to introduce an entire new element just to support a single operation. Why\nnot just make that operation itself the new element?\nSwitch it Up\nIn most conceptions of a flowchart that I’ve seen a conditional is usually\nrepresented as a node with a different shape than the other nodes (often a\ndiamond). Ginger could borrow this idea for itself, and declare a new graph\nelement, alongside nodes, tuples, and edges, called a switch.\nLet’s say a switch is simply represented by a -&lt;&gt;, and acts like a node in all\naspects except that it has no value and is not unique to the graph.\nThe example presented in the previous post would look something like\nthis:\n       in -&gt; } -&gt; } -&lt;&gt; -0-&gt; } -add-&gt; out\nin -1-&gt; } -&gt; }    }     -1-&gt; } -sub-&gt; out\nin -0-&gt; }         }\n                  }\n         in -lt-&gt; }\n\nThis isn’t the worst. Like the fork it’s adding a new element, but that\nelement’s existence is required and its usage is very specific to that\nrequirement, whereas the fork’s existence is required but ambiguously useful\noutside of that requirement.\nOn the other hand, there are macros to consider…\nMacrophillic\nGinger will certainly support macros, and as alluded to in the last post I’d\nlike even conditional operations to be fair game for those who want to construct\ntheir own more complex operators. In the context of the switch -&lt;&gt; element,\nwould someone be able to create something like a pattern matching conditional?\nIf the builtin conditional is implemented as a new graph element then it seems\nthat the primary way to implement a custom conditional macro will also involve a\nnew graph element.\nWhile I’m not flat out opposed to allowing for custom graph elements, I’m\nextremely skeptical that it’s necessary, and would like it to be proven\nnecessary before considering it. So if we can have a basic conditional, and\ncustom conditional macros built on top of the same broadly useful element, that\nseems like the better strategy.\nSo all of that said, it seems I’m leaning towards forks as the better strategy\nin this. But I’d like a different name. “Fork” was nice as being the compliment\nof a “junction”, but I like “tuple” way more than “junction” because the term\napplies well both to the structural element and to the transformation that\nelement performs (i.e. a tuple element combines its input edges’ values into a\ntuple value). But “tuple” and “fork” seem weird together…\nMany Minutes Later…\nA brief search of the internet reveals no better word than “fork”. A place\nwhere a tree’s trunk splits into two separate trunks is called a “fork”. A\nplace where a river splits into two separate rivers is called a “fork”.\nSimilarly with roads. And that is what’s happening, from the point of view of\nthe graph’s structure: it is an element whose only purpose is to denote multiple\noutward edges.\nSo “fork” it is.\nOther considerations\nA 1-tuple is interesting in that it acts essentially as a concatenation of two\nedges. A 1-fork could, theoretically, do the same thing:\na -foo-&gt; } -bar-&gt; b\nc -far-&gt; { -boo-&gt; d\n\nThe top uses a tuple, the bottom a fork. Each is, conceptually, valid, but I\ndon’t like that two different elements can be used for the exact same use-case.\nA 1-tuple is an established concept in data structures, so I am loath to give it\nup.  A 1-fork, on the other hand, doesn’t make sense structurally (would you\npoint to any random point on a river and call it a “1-fork”?), and fork as a\nwhole doesn’t really have any analog in the realm of data structures. So I’m\nprepared to declare 1-forks invalid from the viewpoint of the language\ninterpreter.\nAnother consideration: I already expect that there’s going to be confusion as to\nwhen to use a fork and when to use multiple outputs from a node. For example,\nhere’s a graph which uses a fork:\na -&gt; { -op1-&gt; foo\n     { -op2-&gt; bar\n\nand here’s a graph which has multiple outputs from the same node:\na -op1-&gt; foo\n  -op2-&gt; bar\n\nEach could be interpreted to mean the same thing: “set foo to the result of\npassing a into op1, and set bar to the result of passing a into op2.”\nAs with the 1-tuple vs 1-fork issue, we have another case where the same\ntask might be accomplished with two different patterns. This case is trickier\nthough, and I don’t have as confident an answer.\nI think an interim rule which could be put in place, subject to review later, is\nthat multiple edges from a node or tuple indicate that that same value is being\nused for multiple operations, while a fork indicates something specific to the\noperation on its input edge. It’s not a pretty rule, but I think it will do.\nStay tuned for next week when I realize that actually all of this is wrong and\nwe start over again!\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-conditionals-in-ginger-errata/","title":"Conditionals in Ginger, Errata"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-conditionals-in-ginger/":{"body":"In the last ginger post I covered a broad overview of how I envisioned\nginger would work as a language, but there were two areas where I felt there was\nsome uncertainty: conditionals and loops. In this post I will be focusing on\nconditionals, and going over a couple of options for how they could work.\nPreface\nBy “conditional” I’m referring to what programmers generally know as the “if”\nstatement; some mechanism by which code can do one thing or another based on\ncircumstances at runtime. Without some form of a conditional a programming\nlanguage is not Turing-complete and can’t be used for anything interesting.\nGiven that it’s uncommon to have a loop without some kind of a conditional\ninside of it (usually to exit the loop), but it’s quite common to have a\nconditional with no loop in sight, it makes more sense to cover conditionals\nbefore loops. Whatever decision is reached regarding conditionals will impact\nhow loops work, but not necessarily the other way around.\nFor the duration of this post I will be attempting to construct a simple\noperation which takes two integers as arguments. If the first is less than\nthe second then the operation returns the addition of the two, otherwise the\noperation returns the second subtracted from the first. In go this operation\nwould look like:\nfunc op(a, b int) int {\n    if a &lt; b {\n        return a + b\n    }\n    return b - a\n}\n\nPattern 1: Branches As Inputs\nThe pattern I’ll lay out here is simultaneously the first pattern which came to\nme when trying to figure this problem out, the pattern which is most like\nexisting mainstream programming languages, and (in my opinion) the worst pattern\nof the bunch. Here is what it looks like:\n        in -lt-&gt; } -if-&gt; out\n                 }\n       in -add-&gt; }\n                 }\nin -1-&gt; }        }\nin -0-&gt; } -sub-&gt; }\n\nThe idea here is that the operation if could take a 3-tuple whose elements\nare, respectively: a boolean, and two other edges which won’t be evaluated until\nif is evaluated. If the boolean is true then if outputs the output of the\nfirst edge (the second element in the tuple), and otherwise it will output the\nvalue of the second edge.\nThis idea doesn’t work for a couple reasons. The biggest is that, if there were\nmultiple levels of if statements, the structure of the graph grows out\nleftward, whereas the flow of data is rightwards. For someone reading the code\nto know what if will produce in either case they must first backtrack through\nthe graph, find the origin of that branch, then track that leftward once again\nto the if.\nThe other reason this doesn’t work is because it doesn’t jive with any pattern\nfor loops I’ve come up with. This isn’t evident from this particular example,\nbut consider what this would look like if either branch of the if needed to\nloop back to a previous point in the codepath. If that’s a difficult or\nconfusing task for you, you’re not alone.\nPattern 2: Pattern Matching\nThere’s quite a few languages with pattern matching, and even one which I know\nof (erlang) where pattern matching is the primary form of conditionals, and the\nmore common if statement is just some syntactic sugar on top of the pattern\nmatching.\nI’ve considered pattern matching for ginger. It might look something like:\n       in -&gt; } -switch-&gt; } -&gt; {{{A, B}, _}, ({A,B}-lt-&gt;out)} -0-&gt; } -add-&gt; out\nin -1-&gt; } -&gt; }           } -1-&gt; } -sub-&gt; out\nin -0-&gt; }\n\nThe switch operation posits that a node can have multiple output edges. In a\ngraph this is fine, but it’s worth noting. Graphs tend to be implemented such\nthat edges to and from a node are unordered, but in ginger it seems unlikely\nthat that will be the case.\nThe last output edge from the switch is the easiest to explain: it outputs the\ninput value to switch when no other branches are able to be taken. But the\ninput to switch is a bit complex in this example: It’s a 2-tuple whose first\nelement is in, and whose second element is in but with reversed elements.\nIn the last output edge we immediately pipe into a 1 operation to retrieve\nthat second element and call sub on that, since that’s the required behavior\nof the example.\nAll other branches (in this switch there is only one, the first branch) output\nto a value. The form of this value is a tuple (denoted by enclosed curly braces\nhere) of two values. The first value is the pattern itself, and the second is an\noptional predicate. The pattern in this example will match a 2-tuple, ignoring\nthe second element in that tuple. The first element will itself be matched\nagainst a 2-tuple, and assign each element to the variables A and B,\nrespectively. The second element in the tuple, the predicate, is a sub-graph\nwhich returns a boolean, and can be used for further specificity which can’t be\ncovered by the pattern matching (in this case, comparing the two values to each\nother).\nThe output from any of switch’s branches is the same as its input value, the\nonly question is which branch is taken. This means that there’s no backtracking\nwhen reading a program using this pattern; no matter where you’re looking you\nwill only have to keep reading rightward to come to an out.\nThere’s a few drawbacks with this approach. The first is that it’s not actually\nvery easy to read. While pattern matching can be a really nice feature in\nlanguages that design around it, I’ve never seen it used in a LISP-style\nlanguage where the syntax denotes actual datastructures, and I feel that in such\na context it’s a bit unwieldy. I could be wrong.\nThe second drawback is that pattern matching is not simple to implement, and I’m\nnot even sure what it would look like in a language where graphs are the primary\ndatastructure. In the above example we’re only matching into a tuple, but how\nwould you format the pattern for a multi-node, multi-edge graph? Perhaps it’s\npossible. But given that any such system could be implemented as a macro on top\nof normal if statements, rather than doing it the other way around, it seems\nbetter to start with the simpler option.\n(I haven’t talked about it yet, but I’d like for ginger to be portable to\nmultiple backends (i.e. different processor architectures, vms, etc). If the\nbuiltins of the language are complex, then doing this will be a difficult task,\nwhereas if I’m conscious of that goal during design I think it can be made to be\nvery simple. In that light I’d prefer to not require pattern matching to be a\nbuiltin.)\nThe third drawback is that the input to the switch requires careful ordering,\nespecially in cases like this one where a different value is needed depending on\nwhich branch is taken. I don’t consider this to be a huge drawback, as\nencourages good data design and is a common consideration in other functional\nlanguages.\nPattern 3: Branches As Outputs\nTaking a cue from the pattern matching example, we can go back to if and take\nadvantage of multiple output edges being a possibility:\n       in -&gt; } -&gt; } -if-&gt; } -0-&gt; } -add-&gt; out\nin -1-&gt; } -&gt; }    }       } -1-&gt; } -sub-&gt; out\nin -0-&gt; }         }\n                  }\n         in -lt-&gt; }\n\nIt’s not perfect, but I’d say this is the nicest of the three options so far.\nif is an operation which takes a 2-tuple. The second element of the tuple is a\nboolean, if the boolean is true then if passes the first element of its tuple\nto the first branch, otherwise it passes it to the second. In this way if\nbecomes kind of like a fork in a train track: it accepts some payload (the first\nelement of its input tuple) and depending on conditions (the second element) it\ndirects the payload one way or the other.\nThis pattern retains the benefits of the pattern matching example, where one\nnever needs to backtrack in order to understand what is about to happen next,\nwhile also being much more readable and simpler to implement. It also retains\none of the drawbacks of the pattern matching example, in that the inputs to if\nmust be carefully organized based on the needs of the output branches. As\nbefore, I don’t consider this to be a huge drawback.\nThere’s other modifications which might be made to this if to make it even\ncleaner, e.g. one could make it accept a 3-tuple, rather than a 2-tuple, in\norder to supply differing values to be used depending on which branch is taken.\nTo me these sorts of small niceties are better left to be implemented as macros,\nbuilt on top of a simpler but less pleasant builtin.\nFin\nIf you have other ideas around how conditionals might be done in a graph-based\nlanguage please email me; any and all contributions are welcome! One\nday I’ll get around to actually implementing some of ginger, but today is not\nthat day.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-conditionals-in-ginger/","title":"Conditionals in Ginger"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-evaluation-of-network-filesystems/":{"body":"It’s been a bit since updating my progress on what I’ve been lately calling the\n“cryptic nebula” project. When I last left off I was working on building the\nmobile nebula using nix. For the moment I gave up on\nthat dream, as flutter and nix just really don’t get along and I don’t want to\nget to distracted on problems that aren’t critical to the actual goal.\nInstead I’d like to pursue the next critical component of the system, and\nthat’s a shared filesystem. The use-case I’m ultimately trying to achieve is:\n\n  All hosts communicate with each other via the nebula network.\n  All hosts are personal machines owned by individuals, not cloud VMs.\n  A handful of hosts are always-on, or at least as always-on as can be achieved\nin a home environment.\n  All hosts are able to read/write to a shared filesystem, which is mounted via\nFUSE (or some other mechanism, though I can’t imagine what) on their computer.\n  Top-level directories within the shared filesystem can be restricted, so\nthat only a certain person (or host) can read/write to them.\n\nWhat I’m looking for is some kind of network filesystem, of which there are\nmany. This document will attempt to evaluate all relevant projects and come up\nwith the next steps. It may be that no project fits the bill perfectly, and that\nI’m stuck either modifying an existing project to my needs or, if things are\nlooking really dire, starting a new project.\nThe ultimate use-case here is something like a self-hosted, distributed keybase\nfilesystem; somewhere where individuals in\nthe cluster can back up their personal projects, share files with each other,\nand possibly even be used as the base layer for more complex applications on\ntop.\nThe individuals involved shouldn’t have to deal with configuring their\ndistributed FS, either to read from it or add storage resources to it. Ideally\nthe FS process can be bundled together with the nebula process and run opaquely;\nthe user is just running their “cryptic nebula” process and everything else is\nhandled in the background.\nLow Pass Filter\nThere are some criteria for these projects that I’m not willing to compromise\non; these criteria will form a low pass filter which, hopefully, will narrow our\nsearch appreciably.\nThe network filesystem used by the cryptic nebula must:\n\n  Be able to operate over a nebula network (obviously).\n  Be open-source. The license doesn’t matter, as long as the code is available.\n  Run on both Mac and Linux.\n  Not require a third-party to function.\n  Allows for a replication factor of 3.\n  Supports sharding of data (ie each host need not have the entire dataset).\n  Allow for mounting a FUSE filesystem in any hosts’ machine to interact with\nthe network filesystem.\n  Not run in the JVM, or any other VM which is memory-greedy.\n\nThe last may come across as mean, but the reason for it is that I forsee the\nnetwork filesystem client running on users’ personal laptops, which cannot be\nassumed to have resources to spare.\nRubric\nEach criteria in the next set lies along a spectrum. Any project may meet one of\nthses criteria fully, partially, or not at all. For each criteria I assign a\npoint value according to how fully a project meets the criteria, and then sum up\nthe points to give the project a final score.

There\nare many, many different possibilities, so this may not be an exhaustive list.\nCeph\n\n  The Ceph File System, or CephFS, is a POSIX-compliant file system built on\ntop of Ceph’s distributed object store, RADOS. CephFS endeavors to provide a\nstate-of-the-art, multi-use, highly available, and performant file store for\na variety of applications, including traditional use-cases like shared home\ndirectories, HPC scratch space, and distributed workflow shared storage.\n\n\n  Hackability: 2. Very active community, but it’s C++.\n  Documentation: 2. Hella docs, very daunting.\n  Transience: 0. Adding hosts seems to require multiple configuration steps.\n  Priority: 1. There is fine-tuning on a per-host basis.\n  Caching: 1. Clients can cache both metadata and block data.\n  Conflicts: 1. The FS behaves as much like a real FS as possible.\n  Consistency: 0. System is CP.\n  POSIX: 2. Fully POSIX compliant.\n  Scale: 2. Cluster can grow without any real bounds.\n  Failure: 3. There’s no indication anywhere that Ceph goes into any kind of cluster-wide failure mode.\n  Limitations: 2. There are performance considerations with large directories, but no hard limits.\n  Encryption: 0. None to speak of.\n  Permissions: 2. POSIX ACLs supported.\n  Administration: 1. This is a guess, but Ceph seems to be self-healing in general, but still needs hand-holding in certain situations (adding/removing nodes, etc…)\n  Simplicity: 0. There are many moving pieces, as well as many different kinds of processes and entities.\n  Visibility: 3. Lots of tooling to dig into the state of the cluster, as well as a prometheus module.\n\nTOTAL: 22\nComments\nCeph has been recommended to me by a few people. It is clearly a very mature\nproject, though that maturity has brought with it a lot of complexity. A lot of\nthe complexity of Ceph seems to be rooted in its strong consistency guarantees,\nwhich I’m confident it fulfills well, but are not really needed for the\nuse-case I’m interested in. I’d prefer a simpler, eventually consistent,\nsystem. It’s also not clear to me that Ceph would even perform very well in my\nuse-case as it seems to want an actual datacenter deployment, with beefy\nhardware and hosts which are generally close together.\nGlusterFS\n\n  GlusterFS is a scalable network filesystem suitable for data-intensive tasks\nsuch as cloud storage and media streaming. GlusterFS is free and open source\nsoftware and can utilize common off-the-shelf hardware.\n\n\n  Hackability: 2. Mostly C code, but there is an active community.\n  Documentation: 2. Good docs.\n  Transience: 0. New nodes cannot add themselves to the pool.\n  Priority: 0. Data is distributed based on consistent hashing algo, nothing else.\n  Caching: 1. Docs mention client-side caching layer.\n  Conflicts: 0. File becomes frozen, manual intervention is needed to save it.\n  Consistency: 0. Gluster aims to be fully consistent.\n  POSIX: 2. Fully POSIX compliant.\n  Scale: 2. No apparent limits.\n  Failure: 3. Clients determine on their own whether or not they have a quorum for a particular sub-volume.\n  Limitations: 2. Limited by the file system underlying each volume, I think.\n  Encryption: 2. Encryption can be done on the volume level, each user could have a private volume.\n  Permissions: 2. ACL checking is enforced on the server-side, but requires syncing of users and group membership across servers.\n  Administration: 1. Beyond adding/removing nodes the system is fairly self-healing.\n  Simplicity: 1. There’s only one kind of server process, and the configuration of volumes is is well documented and straightforward.\n  Visibility: 3. Prometheus exporter available.\n\nTOTAL: 23\nComments\nGlusterFS was my initial choice when I did a brief survey of DFSs for this\nuse-case. However, after further digging into it I think it will suffer the\nsame ultimate problem as CephFS: too much consistency for a wide-area\napplication like I’m envisioning. The need for syncing user/groups across\nmachines as actual system users is also cumbersome enough to make it not a\ngreat choice.\nMooseFS\n\n  MooseFS is a Petabyte Open Source Network Distributed File System. It is easy\nto deploy and maintain, highly reliable, fault tolerant, highly performing,\neasily scalable and POSIX compliant.\nMooseFS spreads data over a number of commodity servers, which are visible to\nthe user as one resource. For standard file operations MooseFS acts like\nordinary Unix-like file system.\n\n\n  Hackability: 2. All C code, pretty dense, but backed by a company.\n  Documentation: 2. There’s a giant PDF you can read through like a book. I\nguess that’s…. good?\n  Transience: 0. Nodes must be added manually.\n  Priority: 1. There’s “Storage Classes”.\n  Caching: 1. Caching is done on the client, and there’s some synchronization\nwith the master server around it.\n  Conflicts: 1. Both update operations will go through.\n  Consistency: 0. Afaict it’s a fully consistent system, with a master server\nbeing used to synchronize changes.\n  POSIX: 2. Fully POSIX compliant.\n  Scale: 2. Cluster can grow without any real bounds.\n  Failure: 1. If the master server is unreachable then the client can’t\nfunction.\n  Limitations: 2. Limits are very large, effectively no limit.\n  Encryption: 0. Docs make no mention of encryption.\n  Permissions: 1. Afaict permissions are done by the OS on the fuse mount.\n  Administration: 1. It seems that if the topology is stable there shouldn’t be\nmuch going on.\n  Simplicity: 0. There are many moving pieces, as well as many different kinds of processes and entities.\n  Visibility: 2. Lots of cli tooling, no prometheus metrics that I could find.\n\nTOTAL: 17\nOverall MooseFS seems to me like a poor-developer’s Ceph. It can do exactly the\nsame things, but with less of a community around it. The sale’s pitch and\nfeature-gating also don’t ingratiate it to me. The most damning “feature” is the\nmaster metadata server, which acts as a SPOF and only sort of supports\nreplication (but not failover, unless you get Pro).\nCutting Room Floor\nThe following projects were intended to be reviewed, but didn’t make the cut for\nvarious reasons.\n\n  \n    Tahoe-LAFS: The FUSE mount (which is actually an SFTP mount) doesn’t support\nmutable files.\n  \n  \n    HekaFS: Doesn’t appear to exist anymore(?)\n  \n  \n    IPFS-cluster: Doesn’t support sharding.\n  \n  \n    MinFS: Seems to only work off S3, no longer maintained anyway.\n  \n  \n    DRDB: Linux specific, no mac support.\n  \n  \n    BeeGFS: No mac support (I don’t think? I couldn’t find any indication it\nsupports macs at any rate).\n  \n  \n    NFS: No support for sharding the dataset.\n  \n\nConclusions\nGoing through the featuresets of all these different projects really helped me\nfocus in on how I actually expect this system to function, and a few things\nstood out to me:\n\n  \n    Perfect consistency is not a goal, and is ultimately harmful for this\nuse-case. The FS needs to propagate changes relatively quickly, but if two\ndifferent hosts are updating the same file it’s not necessary to synchronize\nthose updates like a local filesystem would; just let one changeset clobber\nthe other and let the outer application deal with coordination.\n  \n  \n    Permissions are extremely important, and yet for all these projects are\ngenerally an afterthought. In a distributed setting we can’t rely on the OS\nuser/groups of a host to permission read/write access. Instead that must be\ndone primarily via e2e encryption.\n  \n  \n    Transience is not something most of these project expect, but is a hard\nrequirement of this use-case. In the long run we need something which can be\nrun on home hardware on home ISPs, which is not reliable at all. Hosts need to\nbe able to flit in and out of existence, and the cluster as a whole needs to\nself-heal through that process.\n  \n\nIn the end, it may be necessary to roll our own project for this, as I don’t\nthink any of the existing distributed file systems are suitable for what’s\nneeded.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-evaluation-of-network-filesystems/","title":"Evaluation of Network Filesystems"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-ginger/":{"body":"This post is about a programming language that’s been bouncing around in my head\nfor a long time.

But it is\nan ASL, each character representing a single command, executed by the brainfuck\nruntime from left to right.)\nASLs did the job at the time, but luckily we’ve mostly moved on past them.\nAbstract Syntax Trees\nEventually programmers upgraded to C-like languages. Rather than a sequence of\ncommands, these languages were syntactically represented by an “abstract syntax\ntree” (AST). Rather than executing commands in essentially the same order they\nare written, an AST language compiler reads the syntax into a tree of syntax\nnodes. What it then does with the tree is language dependent.\nHere’s a program which outputs all numbers from 0 to 9 to stdout, written in\n(slightly non-idiomatic) Go:\ni := 0\nfor {\n    if i == 10 {\n        break\n    }\n    fmt.Println(i)\n    i++\n}\n\nWhen the Go compiler sees this, it’s going to first parse the syntax into an\nAST. The AST might look something like this:\n(root)\n   |-(:=)\n   |   |-(i)\n   |   |-(0)\n   |\n   |-(for)\n       |-(if)\n       |  |-(==)\n       |  |  |-(i)\n       |  |  |-(10)\n       |  |\n       |  |-(break)\n       |\n       |-(fmt.Println)\n       |       |-(i)\n       |\n       |-(++)\n           |-(i)\n\nEach of the non-leaf nodes in the tree represents an operation, and the children\nof the node represent the arguments to that operation, if any. From here the\ncompiler traverses the tree depth-first in order to turn each operation it finds\ninto the appropriate machine code.\nThere’s a sub-class of AST languages called the LISP (“LISt Processor”)\nlanguages. In a LISP language the AST is represented using lists of elements,\nwhere the first element in each list denotes the operation and the rest of the\nelements in the list (if any) represent the arguments. Traditionally each list\nis represented using parenthesis. For example (+ 1 1) represents adding 1 and\n1 together.\nAs a more complex example, here’s how to print numbers 0 through 9 to stdout\nusing my favorite (and, honestly, only) LISP, Clojure:\n(doseq\n    [n (range 10)]\n    (println n))\n\nMuch smaller, but the idea is there. In LISPs there is no differentiation\nbetween the syntax, the AST, and the language’s data structures; they are all\none and the same. For this reason LISPs generally have very powerful macro\nsupport, wherein one uses code written in the language to transform code written\nin that same language. With macros users can extend a language’s functionality\nto support nearly anything they need to, but because macro generation happens\nbefore compilation they can still reap the benefits of compiler optimizations.\nAST Pitfalls\nThe ASL (assembly) is essentially just a thin layer of human readability on top\nof raw CPU instructions. It does nothing in the way of representing code in the\nway that humans actually think about it (relationships of types, flow of data,\nencapsulation of behavior). The AST is a step towards expressing code in human\nterms, but it isn’t quite there in my opinion. Let me show why by revisiting the\nGo example above:\ni := 0\nfor {\n    if i &gt; 9 {\n        break\n    }\n    fmt.Println(i)\n    i++\n}\n\nWhen I understand this code I don’t understand it in terms of its syntax. I\nunderstand it in terms of what it does. And what it does is this:\n\n  with a number starting at 0, start a loop.\n  if the number is greater than 9, stop the loop.\n  otherwise, print the number.\n  add one to the number.\n  go to start of loop.\n\nThis behavior could be further abstracted into the original problem statement,\n“it prints numbers 0 through 9 to stdout”, but that’s too general, as there\nare different ways for that to be accomplished. The Clojure example first\ndefines a list of numbers 0 through 9 and then iterates over that, rather than\nlooping over a single number. These differences are important when understanding\nwhat code is doing.\nSo what’s the problem? My problem with ASTs is that the syntax I’ve written down\ndoes not reflect the structure of the code or the flow of data which is in my\nhead. In the AST representation if you want to follow the flow of data (a single\nnumber) you have to understand the semantic meaning of i and :=; the AST\nstructure itself does not convey how data is being moved or modified.\nEssentially, there’s an extra implicit transformation that must be done to\nunderstand the code in human terms.\nGinger: An Abstract Syntax Graph Language\nIn my view the next step is towards using graphs rather than trees for\nrepresenting our code. A graph has the benefit of being able to reference\n“backwards” into itself, where a tree cannot, and so can represent the flow of\ndata much more directly.\nI would like Ginger to be an ASG language where the language is the graph,\nsimilar to a LISP. But what does this look like exactly? Well, I have a good\nidea about what the graph structure will be like and how it will function, but\nthe syntax is something I haven’t bothered much with yet. Representing graph\nstructures in a text file is a problem to be tackled all on its own. For this\npost we’ll use a made-up, overly verbose, and probably non-usable syntax, but\nhopefully it will convey the graph structure well enough.\nNodes, Edges, and Tuples\nAll graphs have nodes, where each node contains a value. A single unique value\ncan only have a single node in a graph. Nodes are connected by edges, where\nedges have a direction and can contain a value themselves.\nIn the context of Ginger, a node represents a value as expected, and the value\non an edge represents an operation to take on that value. For example:\n5 -incr-&gt; n\n\n5 and n are both nodes in the graph, with an edge going from 5 to n that\nhas the value incr. When it comes time to interpret the graph we say that the\nvalue of n can be calculated by giving 5 as the input to the operation\nincr (increment). In other words, the value of n is 6.\nWhat about operations which have more than one input value? For this Ginger\nintroduces the tuple to its graph type. A tuple is like a node, except that it’s\nanonymous, which allows more than one to exist within the same graph, as they do\nnot share the same value. For the purposes of this blog post we’ll represent\ntuples like this:\n1 -&gt; } -add-&gt; t\n2 -&gt; }\n\nt’s value is the result of passing a tuple of two values, 1 and 2, as\ninputs to the operation add. In other words, the value of t is 3.\nFor the syntax being described in this post we allow that a single contiguous\ngraph can be represented as multiple related sections. This can be done because\neach node’s value is unique, so when the same value is used in disparate\nsections we can merge the two sections on that value. For example, the following\ntwo graphs are exactly equivalent (note the parenthesis wrapping the graph which\nhas been split):\n1 -&gt; } -add-&gt; t -incr-&gt; tt\n2 -&gt; }\n\n(\n    1 -&gt; } -add-&gt; t\n    2 -&gt; }\nt -incr-&amp;gt; tt\n\n)\n\n(tt is 4 in both cases.)\nA tuple with only one input edge, a 1-tuple, is a no-op, semantically, but can\nbe useful structurally to chain multiple operations together without defining\nnew value names. In the above example the t value can be eliminated using a\n1-tuple.\n1 -&gt; } -add-&gt; } -incr-&gt; tt\n2 -&gt; }\n\nWhen an integer is used as an operation on a tuple value then the effect is to\noutput the value in the tuple at that index. For example:\n1 -&gt; } -0-&gt; } -incr-&gt; t\n2 -&gt; }\n\n(t is 2.)\nOperations\nWhen a value sits on an edge it is used as an operation on the input of that\nedge. Some operations will no doubt be builtin, like add, but users should be\nable to define their own operations. This can be done using the in and out\nspecial values. When a graph is used as an operation it is scanned for both in\nand out values. in is set to the input value of the operation, and the value\nof out is used as the output of the operation.\nHere we will define the incr operation and then use it. Note that we set the\nincr value to be an entire sub-graph which represents the operation’s body.\n( in -&gt; } -add-&gt; out\n   1 -&gt; }            ) -&gt; incr\n5 -incr-&gt; n\n\n(n is 6.)\nThe output of an operation may itself be a tuple. Here’s an implementation and\nusage of double-incr, which increments two values at once.\n( in -0-&gt; } -incr-&gt; } -&gt; out\n                    }\n  in -1-&gt; } -incr-&gt; }        ) -&gt; double-incr\n1 -&gt; } -double-incr-&gt; t -add-&gt; tt\n2 -&gt; }\n\n(t is a 2-tuple with values 2, and 3, tt is `5.)\nConditionals\nThe conditional is a bit weird, and I’m not totally settled on it yet. For now\nwe’ll use this. The if operation expects as an input a 2-tuple whose first\nvalue is a boolean and whose second value will be passed along. The if\noperation is special in that it has two output edges. The first will be taken\nif the boolean is true, the second if the boolean is false. The second value in\nthe input tuple, the one to be passed along, is used as the input to whichever\nbranch is taken.\nHere is an implementation and usage of max, which takes two numbers and\noutputs the greater of the two. Note that the if operation has two output\nedges, but our syntax doesn’t represent that very cleanly.\n( in -gt-&gt; } -if-&gt; } -0-&gt; out\n     in -&gt; }    -&gt; } -1-&gt; out ) -&gt; max\n1 -&gt; } -max-&gt; t\n2 -&gt; }\n\n(t is 2.)\nIt would be simple enough to create a switch macro on top of if, to allow\nfor multiple conditionals to be tested at once.\nLoops\nLoops are tricky, and I have two thoughts about how they might be accomplished.\nOne is to literally draw an edge from the right end of the graph back to the\nleft, at the point where the loop should occur, as that’s conceptually what’s\nhappening. But representing that in a text file is difficult. For now I’ll\nintroduce the special recur value, and leave this whole section as TBD.\nrecur is cousin of in and out, in that it’s a special value and not an\noperation.  It takes whatever value it’s set to and calls the current operation\nwith that as input. As an example, here is our now classic 0 through 9 printer\n(assume println outputs whatever it was input):\n// incr-1 is an operation which takes a 2-tuple and returns the same 2-tuple\n// with the first element incremented.\n( in -0-&gt; } -incr-&gt; } -&gt; out\n            in -1-&gt; }        ) -&gt; incr-1\n( in -eq-&gt; } -if-&gt; out\nin -&gt; }    -&gt; } -0-&gt; } -println-&gt; } -incr-1-&gt; } -&gt; recur ) -&gt; print-range\n0  -&gt; } -print-range-&gt; }\n10 -&gt; }\n\nNext Steps\nThis post is long enough, and I think gives at least a basic idea of what I’m\ngoing for. The syntax presented here is extremely rudimentary, and is almost\ndefinitely not what any final version of the syntax would look like. But the\ngeneral idea behind the structure is sound, I think.\nI have a lot of further ideas for Ginger I haven’t presented here. Hopefully as\ntime goes on and I work on the language more some of those ideas can start\ntaking a more concrete shape and I can write about them.\nThe next thing I need to do for Ginger is to implement (again) the graph type\nfor it, since the last one I implemented didn’t include tuples. Maybe I can\nextend it instead of re-writing it. After that it will be time to really buckle\ndown and figure out a syntax. Once a syntax is established then it’s time to\nstart on the compiler!\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-ginger/","title":"Ginger"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-goodbye-github-pages/":{"body":"Slowly but surely I’m working on moving my digital life back to being\nself-hosted, and this blog was an easy low-hanging fruit to tackle. Previously\nthe blog was hosted on Github Pages, which was easy enough but also in many ways\nrestricting. By self-hosting I’m able to have a lot more control over the\ngeneration, delivery, and functionality of the blog.\nFor reference you can find the source code for the blog at\nhttps://github.com/mediocregopher/blog.mediocregopher.com. Yes, it will one day be hosted\nelsewhere as well.\nNix\nNix is something I’m slowly picking up, but the more I use it the more it grows\non me. Rather than littering my system with ruby versions and packages I’ll\nnever otherwise use, nix allows me to create a sandboxed build pipeline for the\nblog with perfectly reproducible results.\nThe first step in this process is to take the blog’s existing Gemfile.lock and\nturn it into a gemset.nix file, which is essentially a translation of the\nGemfile.lock into a file nix can understand. There’s a tool called\nbundix which does this, and it can be used from a nix shell without\nhaving to actually install anything:\n nix-shell -p bundix --run 'bundix'\n\nThe second step of using nix is to set up a nix expression in the file\ndefault.nix. This will actually build the static files. As a bonus I made my\nexpression to also allow for serving the site locally with dynamic updating\neverytime I change a source file. My default.nix looks like this:\n{\n    # pkgs refers to all \"builtin\" nix pkgs and utilities. By importing from a\n    # URL I'm able to always pin this default.nix to a specific version of those\n    # packages.\n    pkgs ? import (fetchTarball \"https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/cd63096d6d887d689543a0b97743d28995bc9bc3.tar.gz\") {},\n    system ? builtins.currentSystem,\n}:\nlet\n    # bundlerEnv looks for a Gemfile, Gemfile.lock, and gemset.nix inside\n    # gemdir, and derives a package containing ruby and all desired gems.\n    ruby_env = pkgs.bundlerEnv {\n        name = \"ruby_env\";\n        ruby = pkgs.ruby;\n        gemdir = ./.;\n    };\nin\n    {\n        # build will derive a package which contains the generated static\n        # files of the blog.

Like stdenv the ruby_env was given as a\n# dependency to build.sh, so it has to explicitly use it to have access to\n# jekyll. src is another explicit dependency which was given to build.sh, and\n# contains all the actual source files within the src directory of the repo.\n$ruby_env/bin/jekyll build -s \"$src\" -d \"$d\"\n\nWith these pieces in place I can easily regenerate the site like so:\nnix-build -A build\n\nOnce run the static files will exist within a symlink called result in the\nproject’s root. Within the symlink will be a var/www/blog.mediocregopher.com\ntree of directories, and within that will be the generated static files, all\nwithout ever having to have installed ruby.\nThe expression also allows me to serve the blog while I’m working on it. Doing\nso looks like this:\nnix-shell -A serve\n\nWhen run I get a normal jekyll process running in my src directory, serving\nthe site in real-time on port 4000, once again all without ever installing ruby.\nAs a final touch I introduced a simple Makefile to my repo to wrap these\ncommands, because even these were too much for me to remember:\nresult:\n\tnix-build -A build\ninstall: result\nnix-env -i \"$$(readlink result)\"\nclean:\nrm result\nrm -rf _site\nserve:\nnix-shell -A serve\nupdate:\nnix-shell -p bundler --run 'bundler update; bundler lock; bundix; rm -rf .bundle vendor'\n\nWe’ll look at that install target in the next section.\nnginx\nSo now I have the means to build my site quickly, reliably, and without\ncluttering up the rest of my system. Time to actually serve the files.\nMy home server has a docker network which houses most of my services that I run,\nincluding nginx. nginx’s primary job is to listen on ports 80 and 443, accept\nHTTP requests, and direct those requests to their appropriate service based on\ntheir Host header. nginx is also great at serving static content from disk, so\nI’ll take advantage of that for the blog.\nThe one hitch is that nginx is currently running within a docker container,\nas are all my other services. Ideally I would:\n\n  Get rid of the nginx docker container.\n  Build a nix package containing nginx, all my nginx config files, and the blog\nfiles themselves.\n  Run that directly.\n\nUnfortunately extracting nginx from docker is dependent on doing so for all\nother services as well, or at least on running all services on the host network,\nwhich I’m not prepared to do yet. So for now I’ve done something janky.\nIf you look at the Makefile above you’ll notice the install target. What\nthat target does is to install the static blog files to my nix profile, which\nexists at $HOME/.nix-profile. nix allows any package to be installed to a\nprofile in this way. All packages within a profile are independent and can be\nadded, updated, and removed atomically. By installing the built blog package to\nmy profile I make it available at\n$HOME/.nix-profile/var/www/blog.mediocregopher.com.\nSo to serve those files via nginx all I need to do is add a read-only volume to\nthe container…\n-v $HOME/.nix-profile/var/www/blog.mediocregopher.com:/var/www/blog.mediocregopher.com:ro \\\n\n…add a new virtual host to my nginx config…\nserver {\n    listen       80;\n    server_name  blog.mediocregopher.com;\n    root         /var/www/blog.mediocregopher.com;\n}\n\n…and finally direct the blog A record for mediocregopher.com to my home\nserver’s IP. Cloudflare will handle TLS on port 443 for me in this case, as well\nas hide my home IP, which is prudent.\nDeploying\nSo now it’s time to publish this new post to the blog, what are the actual\nsteps? It’s as easy as:\nmake clean install\n\nThis will remove any existing result, regenerate the site (with the new post)\nunder a new symlink, and install/update that newer package to my nix profile,\noverwriting the previous package which was there.\nEDIT: apparently this isn’t quite true. Because $HOME/.nix-profile is a\nsymlink docker doesn’t handle the case of that symlink being updated correctly,\nso I also have to do docker restart nginx for changes to be reflected in\nnginx.\nAnd that’s it! Nix is a cool tool that I’m still getting the hang of, but\nhopefully this post might be useful to anyone else thinking of self-hosting\ntheir site.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-goodbye-github-pages/","title":"Goodbye, Github Pages"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-loops-in-ginger/":{"body":"In previous posts in this series I went over the general idea of the ginger\nprogramming language, and some of its properties. To recap:\n\n  \n    Ginger is a programming language whose syntax defines a directed graph, in the\nsame way that a LISP language’s syntax defines nested lists.\n  \n  \n    Graph edges indicate an operation, while nodes indicate a value.\n  \n  \n    The special values in and out are used when interpreting a graph as a\nfunction.\n  \n  \n    A special node type, the tuple, is defined as being a node whose value is an\nordered set of input edges.\n  \n  \n    Another special node type, the fork, is the complement to the tuple. A fork is\ndefined as being a node whose value is an ordered set of output edges.\n  \n  \n    The special if operation accepts a 2-tuple, the first value being some state\nvalue and the second being a tuple. The if operation expects to be directed\ntowards a 2-fork. If the boolean is true then the top output edge of the fork\nis taken, otherwise the bottom is taken. The state value is what’s passed to\nthe taken edge.\n  \n\nThere were some other detail rules but I don’t remember them off the top of my\nhead.\nLoops\nToday I’d like to go over my ideas for how loops would work in ginger. With\nloops established ginger would officially be a Turing complete language and,\ngiven time and energy, real work could actually begin on it.\nAs with conditionals I’ll start by establishing a base example. Let’s say we’d\nlike to define an operation which prints out numbers from 0 up to n, where n\nis given as an argument. In go this would look like:\nfunc printRange(n int) int {\n    for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {\n        fmt.Println(i)\n    }\n}\n\nWith that established, let’s start looking at different patterns.\nGoto\nIn the olden days the primary looping construct was goto, which essentially\nteleports the program counter (aka instruction pointer) to another place in the\nexecution stack. Pretty much any other looping construct can be derived from\ngoto and some kind of conditional, so it’s a good starting place when\nconsidering loops in ginger.\n(in -println-&gt; } -incr-&gt; out) -&gt; println-incr\n0  -&gt; }    -&gt; } -if-&gt; { -&gt; out\nin -&gt; } -eq-&gt; }       { -&gt; } -upd-&gt; } -+\n^               0 -&gt; }           |\n|    println-incr -&gt; }           |\n|                                |\n+--------------------------------+\n\n(Note: the upd operation is used here for convenience. It takes in three\narguments: A tuple, an index, and an operation. It applies the operation to the\ntuple element at the given index, and returns a new tuple with that index set to\nthe value returned.)\nHere goto is performed using a literal arrow going from the right to left.\nit’s ugly and hard to write, and would only be moreso the more possible gotos an\noperation has.\nIt also complicates our graphs in a significant way: up till now ginger graphs\nhave have always been directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), but by introducing this\nconstruct we allow that graphs might be cyclic. It’s not immediately clear to me\nwhat the consequences of this will be, but I’m sure they will be great. If\nnothign else it will make the compiler much more complex, as each value can no\nlonger be defined in terms of its input edge, as that edge might resolve back to\nthe value itself.\nWhile conceptually sound, I think this strategy fails the practability test. We\ncan do better.\nWhile\nThe while construct is the basic looping primitive of iterative languages\n(some call it for, but they’re just lying to themselves).\nTry as I might, I can’t come up with a way to make while work with ginger.\nwhile ultimately relies on scoped variables being updated in place to\nfunction, while ginger is based on the concept of pipelining a set of values\nthrough a series of operations. From the point of view of the programmer these\noperations are essentially immutable, so the requirement of a variable which can\nbe updated in place cannot be met.\nRecur\nThis pattern is based on how many functional languages, for example erlang,\nhandle looping. Rather than introducing new primitives around looping, these\nlanguage instead ensure that tail calls are properly optimized and uses those\ninstead. So loops are implemented as recursive function calls.\nFor ginger to do this it would make sense to introduce a new special value,\nrecur, which could be used alongside in and out within operations. When\nthe execution path hits a recur then it gets teleported back to the in\nvalue, with the input to recur now being the output from in. Usage of it\nwould look like:\n(\n(in -println-&amp;gt; } -incr-&amp;gt; out) -&amp;gt; println-incr\n\nin    -&amp;gt; } -if-&amp;gt; { -&amp;gt; out\nin -eq-&amp;gt; }       { -&amp;gt; } -upd-&amp;gt; } -&amp;gt; recur\n                 0 -&amp;gt; }\n      println-incr -&amp;gt; }\n\n) -&gt; inner-op\n0  -&gt; } -inner-op-&gt; out\nin -&gt; }\n\nThis looks pretty similar to the goto example overall, but with the major\ndifference that the looping body had to be wrapped into an inner operation. The\nreason for this is that the outer operation only takes in one argument, n, but\nthe loop actually needs two pieces of state to function: n and the current\nvalue. So the inner operation loops over these two pieces of state, and the\nouter operation supplies n and an initial iteration value (0) to that inner\noperation.\nThis seems cumbersome on the surface, but what other languages do (such as\nerlang, which is the one I’m most familiar with) is to provide built-in macros\non top of this primitive which make it more pleasant to use. These include\nfunction polymorphism and a more familiar for construct. With a decent macro\ncapability ginger could do the same.\nThe benefits here are that the graphs remain acyclic, and the syntax has not\nbeen made more cumbersome. It follows conventions established by other\nlanguages, and ensures the language will be capable of tail-recursion.\nMap/Reduce\nAnother functional strategy which is useful is that of the map/reduce power\ncouple. The map operation takes a sequence of values and an operation, and\nreturns a sequence of the same length where the operation has been applied to\neach value in the original sequence individually. The reduce operation is more\ncomplicated (and not necessary for out example), but it’s essentially a\nmechanism to turn a sequence of values into a single value.\nFor our example we only need map, plus one more helper operation: range.\nrange takes a number n and returns a sequence of numbers starting at 0 and\nending at n-1. Our print example now looks like:\nin -range-&gt; } -map-&gt; out\n println -&gt; }\n\nVery simple! Map/reduce is a well established pattern and is probably the\nbest way to construct functional programs. However, the question remains whether\nthese are the best primitives for looping, and I don’t believe they are. Both\nmap and reduce can be derived from conditional and looping primitives like\nif and recur, and they can’t do some things that those primitives can. While\nI expect one of the first things which will be done in ginger is to define map\nand reduce in terms of if and a looping primitive, and use them generously\nthroughout the code, I think the fact that they can be defined in terms of\nlower-level primitives indicates that they aren’t the right looping primitives\nfor ginger.\nConclusion\nUnlike with the conditionals posts, where I started out not really knowing what\nI wanted to do with conditionals, I more or less knew where this post was going\nfrom the beginning. recur is, in my mind, the best primitive for looping in\nginger. It provides the flexibility to be extended to any use-case, while not\ncomplicating the structure of the language. While possibly cumbersome to\nimplement directly, recur can be used as a primitive to construct more\nconvenient looping operations like map and reduce.\nAs a final treat (lucky you!), here’s map defined using if and recur:\n(\n    in -0-&gt; mapped-seq\n    in -1-&gt; orig-seq\n    in -2-&gt; op\nmapped-seq -len-&amp;gt; i\n\n          mapped-seq -&amp;gt; } -if-&amp;gt; { -&amp;gt; out\norig-seq -len-&amp;gt; } -eq-&amp;gt; }       { -&amp;gt; } -append-&amp;gt; } -&amp;gt; recur\n           i -&amp;gt; }                    }           }\n                                     }           }\n               orig-seq -i-&amp;gt; } -op-&amp;gt; }           }\n                                                 }\n                                     orig-seq -&amp;gt; }\n                                           op -&amp;gt; }\n\n) -&gt; inner-map\n() -&gt; } -inner-map-&gt; out\nin -0-&gt; }\nin -1-&gt; }\n\nThe next step for ginger is going to be writing an actual implementation of the\ngraph structure in some other language (let’s be honest, it’ll be in go). After\nthat we’ll need a syntax definition which can be used to encode/decode that\nstructure, and from there we can start actually implementing the language!\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-loops-in-ginger/","title":"Loops in Ginger"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-nfts/":{"body":"NFT stands for “non-fungible token”. The “token” part refers to an NFT being a\ntoken whose ownership is recorded on a blockchain. Pretty much all\ncryptocurrencies, from bitcoin to your favorite shitcoin, could be called tokens\nin this sense. Each token has exactly one owner, and ownership of the token can\nbe transferred from one wallet to another via a transaction on the blockchain.\nWhat sets an NFT apart from a cryptocurrency is the “non-fungible” part.\nCryptocurrency tokens are fungible; one bitcoin is the same as any other bitoin\n(according to the protocol, at least), in the same way as one US dollar holds as\nmuch value as any other US dollar. Fungibility is the property of two units of\nsomething being exactly interchangeable.\nNFTs are not fungible. One is not the same as any other. Each has some piece\nof data attached to it, and each is recorded separately on a blockchain as an\nindividual token. You can think of an NFT as a unique cryptocurrency which has a\nsupply of 1 and can’t be divided.\nDepending on the protocol used to produce an NFT, the data attached to it might\nbe completely independent of its identity, even. It may be possible to produce\ntwo NFTs with the exact same data attached to them (again, depending on the\nprotocol used), but even so those two NFTs will be independent and not\ninterchangeable.\nFUD\nBefore getting into why NFTs are interesting, I want to first address some\ncommon criticism I see of them online (aka, in my twitter feed). The most\ncommon, and unfortunately least legitimate, criticism has to do with the\nenvironmental impact of NFTs. While the impact on energy usage and the\nenvironment when talking about bitcoin is a topic worth going into, bitcoin\ndoesn’t support hosting NFTs and therefore that topic is irrelevant here.\nMost NFTs are hosted on ethereum, which does have a comparable energy footprint\nto bitcoin (it’s somewhat less than half, according to the internet). However,\nethereum is taking actual, concrete steps towards changing its consensus\nmechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), which will cut the\nenergy usage of the network down to essentially nothing. The rollout plan for\nEthereum PoS covers the next couple of years, and after that we don’t really\nhave to worry about the energy usage of NFTs any longer.\nThe other big criticism I hear is about the value and nature of art and what the\nimpact of NFTs are in that area. I’m going to talk more about this in this post,\nbut, simply put, I don’t think that the value and nature of art are immutable,\nanymore than the form of art is immutable. Perhaps NFTs will change art, but\nchange isn’t bad in itself, and furthermore I don’t think they will actually\nchange it all that much. People will still produce art, it’s only the\ndistribution mechanism that might change.\nReal, Useful, Boring Things\nMost of the coverage around NFTs has to do with using them to represent\ncollectibles and art. I’d like to start by talking about other use-cases, those\nwhere NFTs are actually “useful” (in the dull, practical sense).\nEach NFT can carry some piece of data along with it. This data can be anything,\nbut for a practical use-case it needs to be something which indicates ownership\nof some internet good. It cannot be the good itself. For example, an NFT which\ncontains an image does not really convey the ownership of that image; anyone can\ncopy the image data and own that image as well (intellectual property rights be\ndamned!).\nA real use-case for NFTs which I’m already, if accidentally, taking advantage\nof, is domain name registration. I am the proud owner of the\nmediocregopher.eth domain name (the .eth TLD is not yet in wide usage\nin browsers, but one day!). The domain name’s ownership is indicated by an NFT:\nwhoever holds that NFT, which I currently do, has the right to change all\ninformation attached to the mediocregopher.eth domain. If I want to sell the\ndomain all I need to do is sell the NFT, which can be done via an ethereum\ntransaction.\nDomain names work well for NFTs because knowing the data attached to the NFT\ndoesn’t actually do anything for you. It’s the actual ownership of the NFT\nwhich unlocks value. And I think this is the key rule for where to look to apply\nNFTs to practical use-cases: the ownership of the NFT has to unlock some\nfunctionality, not the data attached to it. The functionality has to be digital\nin nature, as well, as anything related to the physical world is not as easily\nguaranteed.\nI haven’t thought of many further practical use-cases of NFTs, but we’re still\nin early stages and I’m sure more will come up. In any case, the practical stuff\nis boring, let’s talk about art.\nArt, Memes, and All Wonderful Things\nFor many the most baffling aspect of NFTs is their use as collectibles. Indeed,\ntheir use as collectibles is their primary use right now, even though these\ncollectibles procur no practical value for their owner; at best they are\nspeculative goods, small gambles, and at worst just a complete waste of money.\nHow can this be?\nThe curmudgeons of the world would have you believe that money is only worth\nspending on goods which offer practical value. If the good is neither consumable\nin a way which meets a basic need, nor produces other goods of further value,\nthen it is worthless. Obviously NFTs fall into the “worthless” category.\nUnfortunately for them, the curmudgeons don’t live in reality. People spend\ntheir money on stupid, pointless shit all the time. I’m prepared to argue that\npeople almost exclusively spend their money on stupid, pointless shit. The\nmonetary value of a good has very little to do with its ability to meet a basic\nnecessity or its ability to produce value (whatever that even really means), and\nmore to do with how owning the shiny thing or doing the fun thing makes us\nstupid monkeys very happy (for a time).\nRather than bemoan NFTs, and our simple irrationality which makes them\ndesirable, let’s embrace them as a new tool for expressing our irrationality to\nthe world, a tool which we have yet to fully explore.\nA Moment Captured\nIt’s 1857 and Jean-François Millet reveals to the world what would become one of\nhis best known works: The Gleaners.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nThe painting depicts three peasants gleaning a field, the bulk of their harvest\nalready stacked high in the background. The wikipedia entry has this\nto say about the painting’s eventual final sale:\n\n  In 1889, the painting, then owned by banker Ferdinand Bischoffsheim, sold for\n300,000 francs at auction. The buyer remained anonymous, but rumours were\nthat the painting was coveted by an American buyer. It was announced less than\na week later that Champagne maker Jeanne-Alexandrine Louise Pommery had\nacquired the piece, which silenced gossip on her supposed financial issues\nafter leaving her grapes on the vines weeks longer than her competitors.\n\nI think we can all breathe a sigh of relief for Jeanne-Alexandrine.\nI’d like to talk about why this painting was worth 300k francs, and really\nwhat makes art valuable at all (aside from the money laundering and tax evasion\nthat high-value art enables). Millet didn’t merely take a picture using paints\nand canvas, an exact replica of what his eyes could see. It’s doubtful this\nscene ever played out in reality, exactly as depicted, at all! It existed only\nwithin Millet himself.\nIn The Gleaners Millet captured far more than an image: the image itself\nconveys the struggle of a humble life, the joy of the harvest, the history of\nthe french peasantry (and therefore the other french societal classes as well),\nthe vastness of the world compared to our little selves, and surely many other\nthings, each dependant on the viewer. The image conveys emotions, and most\nimportantly it conveys emotions captured at a particular moment, a moment which\nno longer exists and will never exist again. The capturing of such a moment by\nan artist capable of doing it some justice, so others can experience it to any\nsignificant degree far into the future, is a rare event.\nAccess to that rare moment is what is being purchased for 300k francs. We refer\nto the painting as the “original”, but really the painting is only the\nfirst-hand reproduction of the moment, which is the true original, and proximity\nto the true original is what is being purchased. All other reproductions must be\nbased on this first-hand one (be they photographs or painted copies), and are\ntherefore second and third-hand.\nConsider the value of a concert ticket; it is based on both how much in demand\nthe performance is, how close to the performance the seating section is, and how\nmany seats in that section there are. When one purchases the “original” The\nGleaners, one is purchasing a front-row ticket to a world-class performance at\na venue with only one seat. That is why it was worth 300k francs.\nI have one final thing to say here and then I’ll move onto the topic at hand:\nthe history of the work compounds its value as well. The Gleaners conveys an\nemotion, but knowing the critical reaction of the french elite at its first\nunveiling can add to that emotion.\nAgain, from the wiki entry:\n\n  Millet’s The Gleaners was also not perceived well due to its large size, 33\ninches by 44 inches, or 84 by 112 centimetres. This was large for a painting\ndepicting labor. Normally this size of a canvas was reserved for religious or\nmythological style paintings. Millet’s work did not depict anything\nreligiously affiliated, nor was there any reference to any mythological\nbeliefs. The painting illustrated a realistic view of poverty and the working\nclass. One critic commented that “his three gleaners have gigantic\npretensions, they pose as the Three Fates of Poverty…their ugliness and\ntheir grossness unrelieved.”\n\nNow scroll back up and see if you don’t now have more affinity for the painting\nthan before you knew that. If so, then the face value just went up, just a\nlittle bit.\nThe Value of an NFT\nWith this acknowledgement of why people desire art, we can understand why they\nwould want an NFT depicting an artwork.\nA few days ago an NFT of this image sold for almost $500k:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n\nMost of the internet knows this image as Disaster Girl, a meme which has been\naround since time immemorial (from the internet’s perspective, anyway, in\nreality it was taken in 2007). The moment captured is funny, the girl in the\nimage smiling as if she had set the fire which blazes in the background. But, as\nwith The Gleaners, the image itself isn’t everything. The countless usages of\nthe image, the original and all of its remixes, all passed around as memes on\nthe internet for the past 14 years, have all worked to add to the image’s\ndemand. Disaster Girl is no longer just a funny picture or a versatile meme\nformat, it’s a piece of human history and nostalgia.\nUnlike physical paintings, however, internet memes are imminently copyable. If\nthey weren’t they could hardly function as memes! We can only have one\n“original” The Gleaners, but anyone with a computer can have an exact, perfect\ncopy of the original Disaster Girl, such that there’s no true original. But if\nI were to put up an NFT of Disaster Girl for sale, I wouldn’t get a damned\npenny for it (probably). Why was that version apparently worth $500k?\nThe reason is that the seller is the girl in the image herself, now 21 years old\nand in college. I have no particular connection to Disaster Girl, so buying an\nNFT from me would be like buying a print of The Gleaners off some rando in the\nstreet; just a shallow copy, worth only the material it’s printed on plus some\nlabor, and nothing more. But when Disaster Girl herself sells the NFT, then the\nbuyer is actually part of the moment, they are entering themselves into the\nhistory of this meme that the whole world has taken a part in for the last 14\nyears! $500k isn’t so unreasonable in that light.\nProperty on the Internet\nI don’t make it a secret that I consider “intellectual property” to be a giant\nfucking scam that the world has unfortunately bought into. Data, be it a\nphysical book or a digital file, is essentially free to copy, and so any price\nplaced on the copying or sharing of knowledge is purely artificial. But we don’t\nhave an alternate mechanism for paying producers of knowledge and art, and so we\ncontinue to treat data as property even though it bears absolutely no\nresemblance to anything of the kind.\nDisaster Girl has not, to my knowledge, asserted any property rights on the\nimage of herself. Doing so in any real sense, beyond going after a handful of\nhigh-value targets who might settle a lawsuit, is simply not a feasible option.\nInstead, by selling an NFT, Disaster Girl has been compensated for her labor\n(meager as it was) in a way which was proportional to its impact on the world,\nall without the invocation of the law. A great success!\nActually, the labor was performed by Disaster Girl’s father, who took the\noriginal image and sent it into a photo contest or something. What would have\nhappened if the NFT was sold in his name? I imagine that it would not have sold\nfor nearly as much. This makes sense to me, even if it does not make sense from\na purely economical point of view. Disaster Girl’s father did the work in the\nmoment, but being a notable figure to the general public is its own kind of\nlabor, and it’s likely that his daughter has born the larger burden over time.\nThe same logic applies to why we pay our movie stars absurd amounts even while\nthe crew makes a “normal” wage.\nShould the father not then get compensated at all? I think he should, and I\nthink he could! If he were to produce an NFT of his own, of the exact same\nimage, it would also fetch a decent price. Probably not 6 figures, possibly not\neven 4, but considering the actual contribution he made (taking a picture and\nuploading it), I think the price would be fair. How many photographers get paid\nanything at all for their off-hand pictures of family outings?\nAnd this is the point I’d like to make: an NFT’s price, like in all art, is\nproportional to the distance to the moment captured. The beauty is that this\ndistance is purely subjective; it is judged not by rules set down in law by\nfallable lawyers, but instead by the public at large. It is, in essence, a\ndemocritization of intellectual property disputes. If multiple people claim to\nhaving produced a single work, let them all produce an NFT, and the market will\ndecide what each of their work is worth.\nWill the market ever be wrong? Certainly. But will it distribute the worth more\nincorrectly than our current system, where artists must sell their rights to a\nlarge publisher in order to see a meager profit, while the publisher rakes in\nthe vastly larger share? I sincerely doubt it.\nContent Creation\nAnother interesting mechanism of NFTs is that some platforms (e.g.\nRarible) allow the seller to attach a royalty percentage to the NFT\nbeing solde. When this is done it means the original seller will receive some\npercentage of all future sales of that NFT.\nI think this opens some interesting possibilities for content creators. Normally\na content creator would need to sell ads or subscriptions in order to profit\nfrom their content, but if they instead/in addition sell NFTs associated with\ntheir content (e.g. one per episode of their youtube show) they can add another\nrevenue stream. As their show, or whatever, begins to take off, older NFTs\nbecome more valuable, and the content creator can take advantage of that new\nincreased value via royalties set on the NFTs.\nThere’s some further interesting side-effects that come from using NFTs in this\nway. If a creator releases a work, and a corresponding NFT for that work, their\nincentive is no longer to gate access to that work (as it would be in our\ncurrent IP system) or burden the work with advertisements and pleas for\nsubscriptions/donations. There’s an entirely new goalpost for the creator:\nactual value to others.\nThe value of the NFT is based entirely and arbitrarily on other’s feelings\ntowards the original work, and so it is in the creator’s interest to increase\nthe visibility and virality of the work. We can expect a creator who has sold an\nNFT for a work, with royalties attached, to actively ensure there is as\nlittle gatekeeping around the work as possible, and to create work which is\ncompletely platform-agnostic and available absolutely everywhere. Releasing a\nwork as public-domain could even become a norm, should NFTs prove more\nprofitable than other revenue streams.\nShill Gang\nWhile the content creator’s relationship with their platform(s) will change\ndrastically, I also expect that their relationship with their fans, or really\ntheir fan’s relationship with the creator’s work, will change even more. Fans\nare no longer passive viewers, they can have an actual investment in a work’s\nsuccess. Where fans currently shill their favorite show or game or whatever out\nof love, they can now also do it for personal profit. I think this is the worst\npossible externality of NFTs I’ve encountered: internet fandom becoming orders\nof magnitude more fierce and unbearable, as they relentlessly shill their\ninvestments to the world at large.\nThere is one good thing to come out of this new fan/content relationship though,\nand that’s the fan’s role in distribution and preservation of work. Since fans\nnow have a financial incentive to see a work persist into the future, they will\ntake it upon themselves to ensure that the works won’t accidentally fall off the\nface of the internet (as things often do). This can be difficult currently since\nwork is often tied down with IP restrictions, but, as we’ve established, work\nwhich uses NFTs for revenue is incentivized to not tie itself down in any way,\nso fans will have much more freedom in this respect.\nArt\nIt seems unlikely to me that art will cease to be created, or cease to be\nvaluable. The human creative instinct comes prior to money, and we have always\ncreated art regardless of economic concerns. It’s true that the nature of our\nart changes according to economics (don’t forget to hit that “Follow” button at\nthe top!), but if anything I think NFTs can change our art for the better. Our\nwork can be more to the point, more accessible, and less encumbered by legal\nbullshit.\nFin\nThat crypto cat is out of the bag, at this point, and I doubt if there’s\nanything that can put it back. The world has never before had the tools that\ncryptocurrency and related technologies (like NFTs) offer, and our lives will\nsurely change as new uses of these tools make themselves apparent. I’ve tried to\nextrapolate some uses and changes that could come out of NFTs here, but I have\nno doubt that I’ve missed or mistook some.\nIt’s my hope that this post has at least offered some food-for-thought related\nto NFTs, beyond the endless hot takes and hype that can be found on social\nmedia, and that the reader can now have a bigger picture view of NFTs and where\nthey might take us as a society, should we embrace them.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-nfts/","title":"NFTs"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-old-code-new-ideas/":{"body":"About 3 years ago I put a lot of effort into a set of golang packages called\nmediocre-go-lib. The idea was to create a framework around\nthe ideas I had laid out in this blog post around the\nstructure and composability of programs. What I found in using the framework was\nthat it was quite bulky, not fully thought out, and ultimately difficult for\nanyone but me to use. So…. a typical framework then.\nMy ideas about program structure haven’t changed a ton since then, but my ideas\naround the patterns which enable that structure have simplified dramatically\n(see my more recent post for more on that). So in that\nspirit I’ve decided to cut a v2 branch of mediocre-go-lib and start trimming\nthe fat.\nThis is going to be an exercise both in deleting old code (very fun) and\nre-examining old code which I used to think was good but now know is bad (even\nmore fun), and I’ve been looking forward to it for some time.\nmcmp, mctx\nThe two foundational pieces of mediocre-go-lib are the mcmp and mctx\npackages. mcmp primarily deals with its mcmp.Component type,\nwhich is a key/value store which can be used by other packages to store and\nretrieve component-level information. Each mcmp.Component exists as a node in\na tree of mcmp.Components, and these form the structure of a program.\nmcmp.Component is able to provide information about its place in that tree as\nwell (i.e. its path, parents, children, etc…).\nIf this sounds cumbersome and of questionable utility that’s because it is. It’s\nalso not even correct, because a component in a program exists in a DAG, not a\ntree. Moreover, each component can keep track of whatever data it needs for\nitself using typed fields on a struct. Pretty much all other packages in\nmediocre-go-lib depend on mcmp to function, but they don’t need to, I just\ndesigned it that way.\nSo my plan of attack is going to be to delete mcmp completely, and repair all\nthe other packages.\nThe other foundational piece of mediocre-go-lib is mctx. Where mcmp\ndealt with arbitrary key/value storage on the component level, mctx deals with\nit on the contextual level, where each go-routine (i.e. thread) corresponds to a\ncontext.Context. The primary function of mctx is this one:\n// Annotate takes in one or more key/value pairs (kvs' length must be even) and\n// returns a Context carrying them.\nfunc Annotate(ctx context.Context, kvs ...interface{}) context.Context\n\nI’m inclined to keep this around for now because it will be useful for logging,\nbut there’s one change I’d like to make to it. In its current form the value of\nevery key/value pair must already exist before being used to annotate the\ncontext.Context, but this can be cumbersome in cases where the data you’d want\nto annotate is quite hefty to generate but also not necessarily going to be\nused. I’d like to have the option to make annotating occur lazily.  For this I\nadd an Annotator interface and a WithAnnotator function which takes it as an\nargument, as well as some internal refactoring to make it all work right:\n// Annotations is a set of key/value pairs representing a set of annotations. It\n// implements the Annotator interface along with other useful post-processing\n// methods.\ntype Annotations map[interface{}]interface{}\n// Annotator is a type which can add annotation data to an existing set of\n// annotations. The Annotate method should be expected to be called in a\n// non-thread-safe manner.\ntype Annotator interface {\nAnnotate(Annotations)\n}\n// WithAnnotator takes in an Annotator and returns a Context which will produce\n// that Annotator's annotations when the Annotations function is called. The\n// Annotator will be not be evaluated until the first call to Annotations.\nfunc WithAnnotator(ctx context.Context, annotator Annotator) context.Context\n\nAnnotator is designed like it is for two reasons. The more obvious design,\nwhere the method has no arguments and returns a map, would cause a memory\nallocation on every invocation, which could be a drag for long chains of\ncontexts whose annotations are being evaluated frequently. The obvious design\nalso leaves open questions about whether the returned map can be modified by\nwhoever receives it. The design given here dodges these problems without any\nobvious drawbacks.\nThe original implementation also had this unnecessary Annotation type:\n// Annotation describes the annotation of a key/value pair made on a Context via\n// the Annotate call.\ntype Annotation struct {\n       Key, Value interface{}\n}\n\nI don’t know why this was ever needed, as an Annotation was never passed into\nnor returned from any function. It was part of the type AnnotationSet, but\nthat could easily be refactored into a map[interface{}]interface{} instead. So\nI factored Annotation out completely.\nmcfg, mrun\nThe next package to tackle is mcfg, which deals with configuration via\ncommand line arguments and environment variables. The package is set up to use\nthe old mcmp.Component type such that each component could declare its own\nconfiguration parameters in the global configuration. In this way the\nconfiguration would have a hierarchy of its own which matches the component\ntree.\nGiven that I now think mcmp.Component isn’t the right course of action it\nwould be the natural step to take that aspect out of mcfg, leaving only a\nbasic command-line and environment variable parser. There are many other basic\nparsers of this sort out there, including one or two I\nwrote myself, and frankly I don’t think the world needs another. So mcfg is\ngoing away.\nThe mrun package is the corresponding package to mcfg; where mcfg\ndealt with configuration of components mrun deals with the initialization and\nshutdown of those same components. Like mcfg, mrun relies heavily on\nmcmp.Component, and doesn’t really have any function with that type gone. So\nmrun is a gonner too.\nmlog\nThe mlog package is primarily concerned with, as you might guess,\nlogging.  While there are many useful logging packages out there none of them\nintegrate with mctx’s annotations, so it is useful to have a custom logging\npackage here. mlog also has the nice property of not being extremely coupled\nto mcmp.Component like other packages; it’s only necessary to delete a handful\nof global functions which aren’t a direct part of the mlog.Logger type in\norder to free the package from that burden.\nWith that said, the mlog.Logger type could still use some work. It’s primary\npattern looks like this:\n// Message describes a message to be logged.\ntype Message struct {\n\tLevel\n\tDescription string\n\tContexts []context.Context\n}\n// Info logs an InfoLevel message.\nfunc (l *Logger) Info(descr string, ctxs ...context.Context) {\nl.Log(mkMsg(InfoLevel, descr, ctxs...))\n}\n\nThe idea was that if the user has multiple Contexts in hand, each one possibly\nhaving some relevant annotations, all of those Contexts’ annotations could be\nmerged together for the log entry.\nLooking back it seems to me that the only thing mlog should care about is the\nannotations, and not where those annotations came from. So the new pattern\nlooks like this:\n// Message describes a message to be logged.\ntype Message struct {\n\tContext context.Context\n\tLevel\n\tDescription string\n\tAnnotators  []Annotators\n}\n// Info logs a LevelInfo message.\nfunc (l *Logger) Info(ctx context.Context, descr string, annotators ...mctx.Annotator)\n\nThe annotations on the given Context will be included, and then any further\nAnnotators can be added on. This will leave room for merr later.\nThere’s some other warts in mlog.Logger that should be dealt with as well,\nincluding some extraneous methods which were only used due to mcmp.Component,\nsome poorly named types, a message handler which didn’t properly clean itself\nup, and making NewLogger take in parameters with which it can be customized as\nneeded (previously it only allowed for a single configuration). I’ve also\nextended Message to include a timestamp, a namespace field, and some other\nuseful information.\nFuture Work\nI’ve run out of time for today, but future work on this package includes:\n\n  Updating merr with support for mctx.Annotations.\n  Auditing the mnet, mhttp, and mrpc packages to see if\nthey contain anything worth keeping.\n  Probably deleting the m package entirely; I don’t even really remember\nwhat it does.\n  Probably deleting the mdb package entirely; it only makes sense in the\ncontext of mcmp.Component.\n  Making a difficult decision about mtest; I put a lot of work into it,\nbut is it really any better than testify?\n\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-old-code-new-ideas/","title":"Old Code, New Ideas"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-program-structure-and-composability/":{"body":"Part 0: Introduction\nThis post is focused on a concept I call “program structure,” which I will try\nto shed some light on before discussing complex program structures. I will then\ndiscuss why complex structures can be problematic to deal with, and will finally\ndiscuss a pattern for dealing with those problems.\nMy background is as a backend engineer working on large projects that have had\nmany moving parts; most had multiple programs interacting with each other, used\nmany different databases in various contexts, and faced large amounts of load\nfrom millions of users. Most of this post will be framed from my perspective,\nand will present problems in the way I have experienced them. I believe,\nhowever, that the concepts and problems I discuss here are applicable to many\nother domains, and I hope those with a foot in both backend systems and a second\ndomain can help to translate the ideas between the two.\nAlso note that I will be using Go as my example language, but none of the\nconcepts discussed here are specific to Go. To that end, I’ve decided to favor\nreadable code over “correct” code, and so have elided things that most gophers\nhold near-and-dear, such as error checking and proper documentation, in order to\nmake the code as accessible as possible to non-gophers as well. As with before,\nI trust that someone with a foot in Go and another language can help me\ntranslate between the two.\nPart 1: Program Structure\nIn this section I will discuss the difference between directory and program\nstructure, show how global state is antithetical to compartmentalization (and\ntherefore good program structure), and finally discuss a more effective way to\nthink about program structure.\nDirectory Structure\nFor a long time, I thought about program structure in terms of the hierarchy\npresent in the filesystem. In my mind, a program’s structure looked like this:\n// The directory structure of a project called gobdns.\nsrc/\n    config/\n    dns/\n    http/\n    ips/\n    persist/\n    repl/\n    snapshot/\n    main.go\n\nWhat I grew to learn was that this conflation of “program structure” with\n“directory structure” is ultimately unhelpful. While it can’t be denied that\nevery program has a directory structure (and if not, it ought to), this does not\nmean that the way the program looks in a filesystem in any way corresponds to\nhow it looks in our mind’s eye.\nThe most notable way to show this is to consider a library package. Here is the\nstructure of a simple web-app which uses redis (my favorite database) as a\nbackend:\nsrc/\n    redis/\n    http/\n    main.go\n\nIf I were to ask you, based on that directory structure, what the program does\nin the most abstract terms, you might say something like: “The program\nestablishes an http server that listens for requests. It also establishes a\nconnection to the redis server. The program then interacts with redis in\ndifferent ways based on the http requests that are received on the server.”\nAnd that would be a good guess. Here’s a diagram that depicts the program\nstructure, wherein the root node, main.go, takes in requests from http and\nprocesses them using redis.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  Example 1\n\nThis is certainly a viable guess for how a program with that directory\nstructure operates, but consider another answer: “A component of the program\ncalled server establishes an http server that listens for requests. server\nalso establishes a connection to a redis server. server then interacts with\nthat redis connection in different ways based on the http requests that are\nreceived on the http server. Additionally, server tracks statistics about\nthese interactions and makes them available to other components. The root\ncomponent of the program establishes a connection to a second redis server, and\nstores those statistics in that redis server.” Here’s another diagram to depict\nthat program.\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  Example 2\n\nThe directory structure could apply to either description; redis is just a\nlibrary which allows for interaction with a redis server, but it doesn’t\nspecify which or how many servers. However, those are extremely important\nfactors that are definitely reflected in our concept of the program’s\nstructure, and not in the directory structure. What the directory structure\nreflects are the different kinds of components available to use, but it does\nnot reflect how a program will use those components.\nGlobal State vs Compartmentalization\nThe directory-centric view of structure often leads to the use of global\nsingletons to manage access to external resources like RPC servers and\ndatabases. In examples 1 and 2 the redis library might contain code which\nlooks something like this:\n// A mapping of connection names to redis connections.\nvar globalConns = map[string]*RedisConn{}\nfunc Get(name string) *RedisConn {\nif globalConns[name] == nil {\nglobalConns[name] = makeRedisConnection(name)\n}\nreturn globalConns[name]\n}\n\nEven though this pattern would work, it breaks with our conception of the\nprogram structure in more complex cases like example 2. Rather than the redis\ncomponent being owned by the server component, which actually uses it, it\nwould be practically owned by all components, since all are able to use it.\nCompartmentalization has been broken, and can only be held together through\nsheer human discipline.\nThis is the problem with all global state. It is shareable among all\ncomponents of a program, and so is accountable to none of them. One must look\nat an entire codebase to understand how a globally held component is used,\nwhich might not even be possible for a large codebase. Therefore, the\nmaintainers of these shared components rely entirely on the discipline of their\nfellow coders when making changes, usually discovering where that discipline\nbroke down once the changes have been pushed live.\nGlobal state also makes it easier for disparate programs/components to share\ndatastores for completely unrelated tasks. In example 2, rather than creating a\nnew redis instance for the root component’s statistics storage, the coder might\nhave instead said, “well, there’s already a redis instance available, I’ll just\nuse that.” And so, compartmentalization would have been broken further. Perhaps\nthe two instances could be coalesced into the same instance for the sake of\nresource efficiency, but that decision would be better made at runtime via the\nconfiguration of the program, rather than being hardcoded into the code.\nFrom the perspective of team management, global state-based patterns do nothing\nexcept slow teams down. The person/team responsible for maintaining the central\nlibrary in which shared components live (redis, in the above examples)\nbecomes the bottleneck for creating new instances for new components, which\nwill further lead to re-using existing instances rather than creating new ones,\nfurther breaking compartmentalization. Additionally the person/team responsible\nfor the central library, rather than the team using it, often finds themselves\nas the maintainers of the shared resource.\nComponent Structure\nSo what does proper program structure look like? In my mind the structure of a\nprogram is a hierarchy of components, or, in other words, a tree. The leaf\nnodes of the tree are almost always IO related components, e.g., database\nconnections, RPC server frameworks or clients, message queue consumers, etc.\nThe non-leaf nodes will generally be components that bring together the\nfunctionalities of their children in some useful way, though they may also have\nsome IO functionality of their own.\nLet’s look at an even more complex structure, still only using the redis and\nhttp component types:\n\n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  Example 3\n\nThis component structure contains the addition of the debug component.\nClearly the http and redis components are reusable in different contexts,\nbut for this example the debug endpoint is as well. It creates a separate\nhttp server that can be queried to perform runtime debugging of the program,\nand can be tacked onto virtually any program. The rest-api component is\nspecific to this program and is therefore not reusable. Let’s dive into it a\nbit to see how it might be implemented:\n// RestAPI is very much not thread-safe, hopefully it doesn't have to handle\n// more than one request at once.\ntype RestAPI struct {\n    redisConn *redis.RedisConn\n    httpSrv   *http.Server\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Statistics exported for other components to see&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;RequestCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"kt\"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;FooRequestCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"kt\"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;BarRequestCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"kt\"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\nfunc NewRestAPI() *RestAPI {\nr := new(RestAPI)\nr.redisConn := redis.NewConn(\"127.0.0.1:6379\")\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// mux will route requests to different handlers based on their URL path.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mux&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;NewServeMux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;HandleFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"/foo\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;fooHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;HandleFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"/bar\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;barHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;httpSrv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;NewServer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mux&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Listen for requests and serve them in the background.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;httpSrv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Listen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\":8000\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\nfunc (r RestAPI) fooHandler(rw http.ResponseWriter, r http.Request) {\nr.redisConn.Command(\"INCR\", \"fooKey\")\nr.RequestCount++\nr.FooRequestCount++\n}\nfunc (r RestAPI) barHandler(rw http.ResponseWriter, r http.Request) {\nr.redisConn.Command(\"INCR\", \"barKey\")\nr.RequestCount++\nr.BarRequestCount++\n}\n\nIn that snippet rest-api coalesced http and redis into a simple REST-like\napi using pre-made library components. main.go, the root component, does much\nthe same:\nfunc main() {\n    // Create debug server and start listening in the background\n    debugSrv := debug.NewServer()\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Set up the RestAPI, this will automatically start listening&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;restAPI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;NewRestAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Create another redis connection and use it to store statistics&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;statsRedisConn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;NewConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"127.0.0.1:6380\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"m\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Second&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;statsRedisConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"SET\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"numReqs\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;restAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;RequestCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;statsRedisConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"SET\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"numFooReqs\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;restAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;FooRequestCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;statsRedisConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"SET\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"numBarReqs\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;restAPI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;BarRequestCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nOne thing that is clearly missing in this program is proper configuration,\nwhether from command-line or environment variables, etc. As it stands, all\nconfiguration parameters, such as the redis addresses and http listen\naddresses, are hardcoded. Proper configuration actually ends up being somewhat\ndifficult, as the ideal case would be for each component to set up its own\nconfiguration variables without its parent needing to be aware. For example,\nredis could set up addr and pool-size parameters. The problem is that there\nare two redis components in the program, and their parameters would therefore\nconflict with each other. An elegant solution to this problem is discussed in\nthe next section.\nPart 2: Components, Configuration, and Runtime\nThe key to the configuration problem is to recognize that, even if there are\ntwo of the same component in a program, they can’t occupy the same place in the\nprogram’s structure. In the above example, there are two http components: one\nunder rest-api and the other under debug. Because the structure is\nrepresented as a tree of components, the “path” of any node in the tree\nuniquely represents it in the structure. For example, the two http components\nin the previous example have these paths:\nroot -&gt; rest-api -&gt; http\nroot -&gt; debug -&gt; http\n\nIf each component were to know its place in the component tree, then it would\neasily be able to ensure that its configuration and initialization didn’t\nconflict with other components of the same type. If the http component sets\nup a command-line parameter to know what address to listen on, the two http\ncomponents in that program would set up:\n--rest-api-listen-addr\n--debug-listen-addr\n\nSo how can we enable each component to know its path in the component structure?\nTo answer this, we’ll have to take a detour through a type, called Component.\nComponent and Configuration\nThe Component type is a made-up type (though you’ll be able to find an\nimplementation of it at the end of this post). It has a single primary purpose,\nand that is to convey the program’s structure to new components.\nTo see how this is done, let’s look at a couple of Component’s methods:\n// Package mcmp\n// New returns a new Component which has no parents or children. It is therefore\n// the root component of a component hierarchy.\nfunc New() *Component\n// Child returns a new child of the called upon Component.\nfunc (Component) Child(name string) Component\n// Path returns the Component's path in the component hierarchy. It will return\n// an empty slice if the Component is the root component.\nfunc (*Component) Path() []string\n\nChild is used to create a new Component, corresponding to a new child node\nin the component structure, and Path is used retrieve the path of any\nComponent within that structure. For the sake of keeping the examples simple,\nlet’s pretend these functions have been implemented in a package called mcmp.\nHere’s an example of how Component might be used in the redis component’s\ncode:\n// Package redis\nfunc NewConn(cmp mcmp.Component, defaultAddr string) RedisConn {\ncmp = cmp.Child(\"redis\")\nparamPrefix := strings.Join(cmp.Path(), \"-\")\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;addrParam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;flag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;paramPrefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"-addr\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;defaultAddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"Address of redis instance to connect to\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// finish setup&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisConn&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nIn our above example, the two redis components’ parameters would be:\n// This first parameter is for the stats redis, whose parent is the root and\n// therefore doesn't have a prefix. Perhaps stats should be broken into its own\n// component in order to fix this.\n--redis-addr\n--rest-api-redis-addr\n\nComponent definitely makes it easier to instantiate multiple redis components\nin our program, since it allows them to know their place in the component\nstructure.\nHaving to construct the prefix for the parameters ourselves is pretty annoying,\nso let’s introduce a new package, mcfg, which acts like flag but is aware\nof Component. Then redis.NewConn is reduced to:\n// Package redis\nfunc NewConn(cmp mcmp.Component, defaultAddr string) RedisConn {\ncmp = cmp.Child(\"redis\")\naddrParam := mcfg.String(cmp, \"addr\", defaultAddr, \"Address of redis instance to connect to\")\n// finish setup\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisConn&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nEasy-peasy.\nBut What About Parse?\nSharp-eyed gophers will notice that there is a key piece missing: When is\nflag.Parse, or its mcfg counterpart, called? When does addrParam actually\nget populated? It can’t happen inside redis.NewConn because there might be\nother components after redis.NewConn that want to set up parameters. To\nillustrate the problem, let’s look at a simple program that wants to set up two\nredis components:\nfunc main() {\n    // Create the root Component, an empty Component.\n    cmp := mcmp.New()\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Create the Components for two sub-components, foo and bar.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpFoo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"foo\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"bar\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Now we want to try to create a redis sub-component for each component.&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// This will set up the parameter \"--foo-redis-addr\", but bar hasn't had a&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// chance to set up its corresponding parameter, so the command-line can't&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// be parsed yet.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;fooRedis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;NewConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"127.0.0.1:6379\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// This will set up the parameter \"--bar-redis-addr\", but, as mentioned&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// before, redis.NewConn can't parse command-line.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;barRedis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;NewConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"127.0.0.1:6379\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// It is only after all components have been instantiated that the&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// command-line arguments can be parsed&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mcfg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\nWhile this solves our argument parsing problem, fooRedis and barRedis are not\nusable yet because the actual connections have not been made. This is a classic\nchicken and the egg problem. The func redis.NewConn needs to make a connection\nwhich it cannot do until after mcfg.Parse is called, but mcfg.Parse cannot\nbe called until after redis.NewConn has returned. We will solve this problem\nin the next section.\nInstantiation vs Initialization\nLet’s break down redis.NewConn into two phases: instantiation and\ninitialization. Instantiation refers to creating the component on the component\nstructure and having it declare what it needs in order to initialize (e.g.,\nconfiguration parameters). During instantiation, nothing external to the\nprogram is performed; no IO, no reading of the command-line, no logging, etc.\nAll that’s happened is that the empty template of a redis component has been\ncreated.\nInitialization is the phase during which the template is filled in.\nConfiguration parameters are read, startup actions like the creation of database\nconnections are performed, and logging is output for informational and debugging\npurposes.\nThe key to making effective use of this dichotomy is to allow all components\nto instantiate themselves before they initialize themselves. By doing this we\ncan ensure, for example, that all components have had the chance to declare\ntheir configuration parameters before configuration parsing is done.\nSo let’s modify redis.NewConn so that it follows this dichotomy. It makes\nsense to leave instantiation-related code where it is, but we need a mechanism\nby which we can declare initialization code before actually calling it. For\nthis, I will introduce the idea of a “hook.”\nBut First: Augment Component\nIn order to support hooks, however, Component will need to be augmented with\na few new methods. Right now, it can only carry with it information about the\ncomponent structure, but here we will add the ability to carry arbitrary\nkey/value information as well:\n// Package mcmp\n// SetValue sets the given key to the given value on the Component, overwriting\n// any previous value for that key.\nfunc (*Component) SetValue(key, value interface{})\n// Value returns the value which has been set for the given key, or nil if the\n// key was never set.\nfunc (*Component) Value(key interface{}) interface{}\n// Children returns the Component's children in the order they were created.\nfunc (Component) Children() []Component\n\nThe final method allows us to, starting at the root Component, traverse the\ncomponent structure and interact with each Component’s key/value store. This\nwill be useful for implementing hooks.\nHooks\nA hook is simply a function that will run later. We will declare a new package,\ncalling it mrun, and say that it has two new functions:\n// Package mrun\n// InitHook registers the given hook to the given Component.\nfunc InitHook(cmp *mcmp.Component, hook func())\n// Init runs all hooks registered using InitHook. Hooks are run in the order\n// they were registered.\nfunc Init(cmp *mcmp.Component)\n\nWith these two functions, we are able to defer the initialization phase of\nstartup by using the same Components we were passing around for the purpose\nof denoting component structure.\nNow, with these few extra pieces of functionality in place, let’s reconsider the\nmost recent example, and make a program that creates two redis components which\nexist independently of each other:\n// Package redis\n// NOTE that NewConn has been renamed to InstConn, to reflect that the returned\n// *RedisConn is merely instantiated, not initialized.\nfunc InstConn(cmp mcmp.Component, defaultAddr string) RedisConn {\ncmp = cmp.Child(\"redis\")\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// we instantiate an empty RedisConn instance and parameters for it. Neither&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// has been initialized yet. They will remain empty until initialization has&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// occurred.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisConn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"nb\"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;RedisConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;addrParam&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mcfg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"addr\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;defaultAddr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"Address of redis instance to connect to\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mrun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;InitHook&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// This hook will run after parameter initialization has happened, and&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// so addrParam will be usable. Once this hook as run, redisConn will be&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// usable as well.&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisConn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;makeRedisConnection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;addrParam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Now that cmp has had configuration parameters and intialization hooks&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// set into it, return the empty redisConn instance back to the parent.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"k\"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisConn&lt;/span&gt;\n\n}\n\n// Package main\nfunc main() {\n// Create the root Component, an empty Component.\ncmp := mcmp.New()\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Create the Components for two sub-components, foo and bar.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpFoo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"foo\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"bar\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Add redis components to each of the foo and bar sub-components.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisFoo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;InstConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpFoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"127.0.0.1:6379\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redisBar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;redis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;InstConn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmpBar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"s\"&gt;\"127.0.0.1:6379\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Parse will descend into the Component and all of its children,&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// discovering all registered configuration parameters and filling them from&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// the command-line.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mcfg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// Now that configuration parameters have been initialized, run the Init&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// hooks for all Components.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;mrun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"o\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;Init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"n\"&gt;cmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=\"p\"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// At this point the redis components have been fully initialized and may be&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=\"c\"&gt;// used.

Codebases naturally accumulate small, domain-specific behaviors and\noptimizations over time, especially around the IO components of the program.\nDatabases are used with specific options that an organization finds useful,\nlogging is performed in particular places, metrics are counted around certain\npieces of code, etc.\nBy programming with component structure in mind, we are able to keep these\noptimizations while also keeping the clarity and compartmentalization of the\ncode intact. We can keep our code flexible and configurable, while also\nre-usable and testable. Also, the simplicity of the tools involved means they\ncan be extended and retrofitted for nearly any situation or use-case.\nOverall, this is a powerful pattern that I’ve found myself unable to do without\nonce I began using it.\nImplementation\nAs a final note, you can find an example implementation of the packages\ndescribed in this post here:\n\n  mcmp\n  mcfg\n  mrun\n\nThe packages are not stable and are likely to change frequently. You’ll also\nfind that they have been extended quite a bit from the simple descriptions found\nhere, based on what I’ve found useful as I’ve implemented programs using\ncomponent structures. With these two points in mind, I would encourage you to\nlook and take whatever functionality you find useful for yourself, and not use\nthe packages directly. The core pieces are not different from what has been\ndescribed in this post.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-program-structure-and-composability/","title":"Program Structure and Composability"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-ripple-a-game/":{"body":"\n    Movement: Arrow keys or WASD\n    Jump: Space\n    Goal: Jump as many times as possible without touching a ripple!\n    \n    Press Jump To Begin!\n\n\nYour browser doesn't support canvas.

I’ve looked into it a few times, but have been discouraged on multiple\nfronts:\n\n  \n    Understanding the protocols underlying email isn’t straightforward; it’s an\nold system, there’s a lot of cruft, lots of auxiliary protocols that are now\nessentially required, and a lot of different services required to tape it all\ntogether.\n  \n  \n    The services which are required are themselves old, and use operational\npatterns that maybe used to make sense but are now pretty freaking cumbersome.\nFor example, postfix requires something like 3 different system accounts.\n  \n  \n    Deviating from the non-standard route and using something like\nMail-in-a-box involves running docker, which I’m trying to avoid.\n  \n\nSo up till now I had let the idea sit, waiting for something better to come\nalong.\nmaddy is, I think, something better. According to the homepage\n“[maddy] replaces Postfix, Dovecot, OpenDKIM, OpenSPF, OpenDMARC and more with\none daemon with uniform configuration and minimal maintenance cost.” Sounds\nperfect! The homepage is clean and to the point, it’s written in go, and the\ndocs appear to be reasonably well written. And, to top it all off, it’s already\nbeen added to nixpkgs!\nSo in this post (and subsequent posts) I’ll be documenting my journey into\ngetting a maddy server running to see how well it works out.\nJust Do It\nI’m almost 100% sure this won’t work, but to start with I’m going to simply get\nmaddy up and running on my home media server as per the tutorial on its site,\nand go from there.\nFirst there’s some global system configuration I need to perform. Ideally maddy\ncould be completely packaged up and not pollute the rest of the system at all,\nand if I was using NixOS I think that would be possible, but as it is I need to\ncreate a user for maddy and ensure it’s able to read the TLS certificates that I\nmanage via LetsEncrypt.\nsudo useradd -mrU -s /sbin/nologin -d /var/lib/maddy -c \"maddy mail server\" maddy\nsudo setfacl -R -m u:maddy:rX /etc/letsencrypt/{live,archive}\n\nThe next step is to set up the nix build of the systemd service file. This is a\nstrategy I’ve been using recently to nix-ify my services without needing to deal\nwith nix profiles. The idea is to encode the nix store path to everything\ndirectly into the systemd service file, and install that file normally. In this\ncase this looks something like:\npkgs.writeTextFile {\n    name = \"mediocregopher-maddy-service\";\n    text = ''\n        [Unit]\n        Description=mediocregopher maddy\n        Documentation=man:maddy(1)\n        Documentation=man:maddy.conf(5)\n        Documentation=https://maddy.email\n        After=network.target\n    [Service]\n    Type=notify\n    NotifyAccess=main\n    Restart=always\n    RestartSec=1s\n\n    User=maddy\n    Group=maddy\n\n    # cd to state directory to make sure any relative paths\n    # in config will be relative to it unless handled specially.\n    WorkingDirectory=/mnt/vol1/maddy\n    ReadWritePaths=/mnt/vol1/maddy\n\n    # ... lots of directives from\n    # https://github.com/foxcpp/maddy/blob/master/dist/systemd/maddy.service\n    # that we'll elide here ...\n\n    ExecStart=${pkgs.maddy}/bin/maddy -config ${./maddy.conf}\n\n    ExecReload=/bin/kill -USR1 $MAINPID\n    ExecReload=/bin/kill -USR2 $MAINPID\n\n    [Install]\n    WantedBy=multi-user.target\n'';\n\n}\n\nWith the service now testable, it falls on me to actually go through the setup\nsteps described in the tutorial.\nFollowing The Tutorial\nThe first step in the tutorial is setting up of domain names, which I first\nperform in cloudflare (where my DNS is hosted) and then reflect into the conf\nfile. Then I point the tls file configuration line at my LetsEncrypt\ndirectory by changing the line to:\ntls file /etc/letsencrypt/live/$(hostname)/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/$(hostname)/privkey.pem\n\nmaddy can access these files thanks to the setfacl command I performed\nearlier.\nAt this point the server should be effectively configured. However, starting it\nvia systemd results in this error:\nfailed to load /etc/letsencrypt/live/mx.mydomain.com/fullchain.pem and /etc/letsencrypt/live/mx.mydomain.com/privkey.pem\n\n(For my own security I’m not going to be using the actual email domain in this\npost, I’ll use mydomain.com instead.)\nThis makes sense… I use a wildcard domain with LetsEncrypt, so certs for the\nmx sub-domain specifically won’t exist. I need to figure out how to tell maddy\nto use the wildcard, or actually create a separate certificate for the mx\nsub-domain. I’d rather the former, obviously, as it’s far less work.\nLuckily, making it use the wildcard isn’t too hard, all that is needed is to\nchange the tls file line to:\ntls file /etc/letsencrypt/live/$(primary_domain)/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/$(primary_domain)/privkey.pem\n\nThis works because my primary_domain domain is set to the top-level\n(mydomain.com), which is what the wildcard cert is issued for.\nAt this point maddy is up and running, but there’s still a slight problem. maddy\nappears to be placing all of its state files in /var/lib/maddy, even though\nI’d like to place them in /mnt/vol1/maddy. I had set the WorkingDirectory in\nthe systemd service file to this, but apparently that’s not enough. After\ndigging through the codebase I discover an undocumented directive which can be\nadded to the conf file:\nstate_dir /mnt/vol1/maddy\n\nKind of annoying, but at least it works.\nThe next step is to fiddle with DNS records some more. I add the SPF, DMARC and\nDKIM records to cloudflare as described by the tutorial (what do these do? I\nhave no fuckin clue).\nI also need to set up MTA-STS (again, not really knowing what that is). The\ntutorial says I need to make a file with certain contents available at the URL\nhttps://mta-sts.mydomain.com/.well-known/mta-sts.txt. I love it when protocol\nhas to give up and resort to another one in order to keep itself afloat, it\nreally inspires confidence.\nAnyway, I set that subdomain up in cloudflare, and add the following to my nginx\nconfiguration:\nserver {\n    listen      80;\n    server_name mta-sts.mydomain.com;\n    include     include/public_whitelist.conf;\nlocation / {\n    return 404;\n}\n\nlocation /.well-known/mta-sts.txt {\n\n    # Check out openresty if you want to get super useful nginx plugins, like\n    # the echo module, out-of-the-box.\n    echo 'mode: enforce';\n    echo 'max_age: 604800';\n    echo 'mx: mx.mydomain.com';\n}\n\n}\n\n(Note: my public_whitelist.conf only allows cloudflare IPs to access this\nsub-domain, which is something I do for all sub-domains which I can put through\ncloudflare.)\nFinally, I need to create some actual credentials in maddy with which to send my\nemail. I do this via the maddyctl command-line utility:\n&gt; sudo maddyctl --config maddy.conf creds create 'me@mydomain.com'\nEnter password for new user:\n&gt; sudo maddyctl --config maddy.conf imap-acct create 'me@mydomain.com'\n\nSend It!\nAt this point I’m ready to actually test the email sending. I’m going to use\nS-nail to do so, and after reading through the docs there I put the\nfollowing in my ~/.mailrc:\nset v15-compat\nset mta=smtp://me%40mydomain.com:password@localhost:587 smtp-use-starttls\n\nAnd attempt the following mailx command to send an email from my new mail\nserver:\n&gt; echo 'Hello! This is a cool email' | mailx -s 'Subject' -r 'Me &lt;me@mydomain.com&gt;' 'test.email@gmail.com'\nreproducible_build: TLS certificate does not match: localhost:587\n/home/mediocregopher/dead.letter 10/313\nreproducible_build: ... message not sent\n\nDamn. TLS is failing because I’m connecting over localhost, but maddy is\nserving the TLS certs for mydomain.com. Since I haven’t gone through the steps\nof exposing maddy publicly yet (which would require port forwarding in my\nrouter, as well as opening a port in iptables) I can’t properly test this with\nTLS not being required. It’s very important that I remember to re-require TLS\nbefore putting anything public.\nIn the meantime I remove the smtp-use-starttls entry from my ~/.mailrc, and\nretry the mailx command. This time I get a different error:\nreproducible_build: SMTP server: 523 5.7.10 TLS is required\n\nIt turns out there’s a further configuration directive I need to add, this time\nin maddy.conf. Within my submission configuration block I add the following\nline:\ninsecure_auth true\n\nThis allows plaintext auth over non-TLS connections. Kind of sketchy, but again\nI’ll undo this before putting anything public.\nFinally, I try the mailx command one more time, and it successfully returns!\nUnfortunately, no email is ever received in my gmail :( I check the maddy logs\nand see what I feared most all along:\nJun 29 08:44:58 maddy[127396]: remote: cannot use MX        {\"domain\":\"gmail.com\",\"io_op\":\"dial\",\"msg_id\":\"5c23d76a-60db30e7\",\"reason\":\"dial tcp 142.250.152.26:25: connect: connection timed out\",\"remote_addr\":\"142.250.152.\n26:25\",\"remote_server\":\"alt1.gmail-smtp-in.l.google.com.\",\"smtp_code\":450,\"smtp_enchcode\":\"4.4.2\",\"smtp_msg\":\"Network I/O error\"}\n\nMy ISP is blocking outbound connections on port 25.

But for now I’m forced to turn off maddy and let this\ndream sit for a little while longer.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-self-hosted-email-with-maddy-a-naive-first-attempt/","title":"Self-Hosted Email With maddy: A Naive First Attempt"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-setting-up-maddy-on-a-vps/":{"body":"In the previous post I left off with being blocked by my ISP from sending\noutbound emails on port 25, effectively forcing me to set up maddy on a\nvirtual private server (VPS) somewhere else.\nAfter some research I chose Vultr as my VPS of choice. They apparently\ndon’t block you from sending outbound emails on port 25, and are in general\npretty cheap. I rented their smallest VPS server for $5/month, plus an\nadditional $3/month to reserve an IPv4 address (though I’m not sure I really\nneed that, I have dDNS set up at home and could easily get that working here as\nwell).\nTLS\nThe first major hurdle was getting TLS certs for mydomain.com (not the real\ndomain) onto my Vultr box. For the time being I’ve opted to effectively\ncopy-paste my local LetsEncrypt setup to Vultr, using certbot to\nperiodically update my records using DNS TXT challenges.\nThe downside to this is that I now require my Cloudflare API key to be present\non the Vultr box, which effectively means that if the box ever gets owned\nsomeone will have full access to all my DNS. For now I’ve locked down the box as\nbest as I can, and will look into changing the setup in the future. There’s two\nways I could go about it:\n\n  \n    SCP the certs from my local box to the remote everytime they’re renewed. This\nwould require setting up a new user on the remote box with very narrow\nprivileges. This isn’t the worst thing though.\n  \n  \n    Use a different challenge method than DNS TXT records.\n  \n\nBut again, I’m trying to set up maddy, not LetsEncrypt, and so I needed to move\non.\nDeployment\nIn the previous post I talked about how I’m using nix to generate a systemd\nservice file which encompasses all dependencies automatically, without needing\nto install anything to the global system or my nix profile.\nSince that’s already been set up, it’s fairly trivial to use nix-copy-closure\nto copy a service file, and all of its dependencies (including configuration)\nfrom my local box to the remote Vultr box. Simply:\nnix-copy-closure -s &lt;ssh host&gt; &lt;nix store path&gt;\n\nI whipped up some scripts around this so that I can run a single make target and\nhave it build the service (and all deps), do a nix-copy-closure to the remote\nhost, copy the service file into /etc/systemd/service, and restart the\nservice.\nChanges\nFor the most part the maddy deployment on the remote box is the same as on the\nlocal one. Down the road I will likely change them both significantly, so that\nthe remote one only deals with SMTP (no need for IMAP) and the local one will\nautomatically forward all submitted messages to it.\nOnce that’s done, and the remote Vultr box is set up on my nebula\nnetwork, there won’t be a need for the remote maddy to do any SMTP\nauthentication, since the submission endpoint can be made entirely private.\nFor now, however, I’ve set up maddy on the remote box’s public interface with\nSMTP authentication enabled, to make testing easier.\nTesting\nAnd now, to test it! I changed the SMTP credentials in my ~/.mailrc file as\nappropriate, and let a test email rip:\necho 'Hello! This is a cool email' | mailx -s 'Subject' -r 'Me &lt;me@mydomain.com&gt;' 'test.email@gmail.com'\n\nThis would, ideally, send an email from my SMTP server (on my domain) to a test\ngmail domain. Unfortunately, it did not do that, but instead maddy spit this out\nin its log:\n\n  maddy[1547]: queue: delivery attempt failed        {“msg_id”:”330a1ed9”,”rcpt”:”mediocregopher@gmail.com”,”reason”:”[2001:19f0:5001:355a:5400:3ff:fe73:3d02] Our system has detected that\\nthis message does not meet IPv6 sending guidelines regarding PTR\\nrecords and authentication.

They\neven allowed me to do it on my box’s IPv6 address which I’m not paying to\nreserve (though I’m not sure what the long-term risks of that are… can it\nchange?).\nOnce done, I attempted to send my email again, and what do you know…\n\nSuccess!\nSo now I can send emails. There are a few next steps from here:\n\n  \n    Get the VPS on my nebula network and lock it down properly.\n  \n  \n    Fix the TLS cert situation.\n  \n  \n    Set up the remote maddy to forward submissions to my local maddy.\n  \n  \n    Use my sick new email!\n  \n\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-setting-up-maddy-on-a-vps/","title":"Setting Up maddy On A VPS"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-the-web/":{"body":"With the recent crisis in the US’s democratic process, there’s been much abuzz\nin the world about social media’s undoubted role in the whole debacle. The\nextent to which the algorithms of Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, TikTok, etc, have\nplayed a role in the radicalization of large segments of the world’s population\nis one popular topic. Another is the tactics those same companies are now\nemploying to try and euthanize the monster they made so much ad money in\ncreating.\nI don’t want to talk about any of that; there is more to the web than\nsocial media. I want to talk about what the web could be, and to do that I want\nto first talk about what it has been.\nWeb 1.0\nIn the 1950’s computers were generally owned by large organizations like\ncompanies, universities, and governments. They were used to compute and manage\nlarge amounts of data, and each existed independently of the other.\nIn the 60’s protocols began to be developed which would allow them to\ncommunicate over large distances, and thereby share resources (both\ncomputational and informational).\nThe funding of ARPANET by the US DoD led to the initial versions of the TCP/IP\nprotocol in the 70’s, still used today as the backbone of virtually all internet\ncommunication. Email also came about from ARPANET around this time.\nThe 80s saw the growth of the internet across the world, as ARPANET gave way to\nNSFNET. It was during this time that the domain name system we use today was\ndeveloped. At this point the internet use was still mostly for large\nnon-commercial organizations; there was little commercial footprint, and little\nprivate access. The first commercially available ISP, which allowed access to\nthe internet from private homes via dialup, wasn’t launched until 1989.\nAnd so we find ourselves in the year 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee (TBL) first\nproposed the World-Wide Web (WWW, or “the web”). You can find the original\nproposal, which is surprisingly short and non-technical,\nhere.\nFrom reading TBL’s proposal it’s clear that what he was after was some mechanism\nfor hosting information on his machine in such a way that others could find and\nview it, without it needing to be explicitly sent to them. He includes the\nfollowing under the “Applications” header:\n\n  The application of a universal hypertext system, once in place, will cover\nmany areas such as document registration, on-line help, project documentation,\nnews schemes and so on.\n\nBut out of such a humble scope grew one of the most powerful forces of the 21st\ncentury. By the end of 1990 TBL had written the first HTML/HTTP browser and\nserver. By the end of 1994 sites like IMDB, Yahoo, and Bianca’s Smut Shack were\nlive and being accessed by consumers. The web grew that fast.\nIn my view the characteristic of the web which catalyzed its adoption so quickly\nwas the place-ness of it. The web is not just a protocol for transferring\ninformation, like email, but instead is a place where that information lives.\nAny one place could be freely linked to any other place, and so complex and\ninteresting relations could be formed between people and ideas. The\ncontributions people make on the web can reverberate farther than they would or\ncould in any other medium precisely because those contributions aren’t tied to\nsome one-off event or a deteriorating piece of physical infrastructure, but are\ninstead given a home which is both permanent and everywhere.\nThe other advantage of the web, at the time, was its simplicity. HTML was so\nsimple it was basically human-readable. A basic HTTP server could be implemented\nas a hobby project by anyone in any language. Hosting your own website was a\nrelatively straightforward task which anyone with a computer and an ISP could\nundertake.\nThis was the environment early adopters of the web found themselves in.\nWeb 2.0\nThe infamous dot-com boom took place in 2001. I don’t believe this was a failure\ninherent in the principles of the web itself, but instead was a product of\npeople investing in a technology they didn’t fully understand. The web, as it\nwas then, wasn’t really designed with money-making in mind. It certainly allowed\nfor it, but that wasn’t the use-case being addressed.\nBut of course, in this world we live in, if there’s money to be made, it will\ncertainly be made.\nBy 2003 the phrase “Web 2.0” started popping up. I remember this. To me “Web\n2.0” meant a new aesthetic on the web, complete with bubble buttons and centered\nfix-width paragraph boxes. But what “Web 2.0” actually signified wasn’t related\nto any new technology or aesthetic. It was a new strategy for how companies\ncould enable use of the web by non-expert users, i.e. users who don’t have the\ninclination or means to host their own website. Web 2.0 was a strategy for\ngiving everyone a place of their own on the web.\n“Web 2.0” was merely a label given to a movement which had already been in\nmotion for years. I think the following Wikipedia excerpt describes this period\nbest:\n\n  In 2004, the term [“Web 2.0”] began its rise in popularity when O’Reilly Media\nand MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks,\nJohn Battelle and Tim O’Reilly outlined their definition of the “Web as\nPlatform”, where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon\nthe desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that\n“customers are building your business for you”. They argued that the\nactivities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or\npictures) could be “harnessed” to create value.\n\nIn other words, Web 2.0 turned the place-ness of the web into a commodity.\nRather than expect everyone to host, or arrange for the hosting, of their own\ncorner of the web, the technologists would do it for them for “free”! This\ncoincided with the increasing complexity of the underlying technology of the\nweb; websites grew to be flashy, interactive, and stateful applications which\ndid things rather than be places which held things. The idea of a hyperlink,\nupon which the success of the web had been founded, became merely an\nimplementation detail.\nAnd so the walled gardens began to be built. Myspace was founded in 2003,\nFacebook opened to the public in 2006, Digg (the precursor to reddit) was\nlaunched in 2004, Flickr launched in 2004 (and was bought by Yahoo in 2005),\nGoogle bought Blogger in 2003, and Twitter launched in 2006. In effect this\nperiod both opened the web up to everyone and established the way we still use\nit today.\nIt’s upon these foundations that current events unfold. We have platforms whose\nonly incentive is towards capturing new users and holding their attention, to\nthe exclusion of other platforms, so they can be advertised to. Users are\nenticed in because they are being offered a place on the web, a place of their\nown to express themselves from, in order to find out the worth of their\nexpressions to the rest of the world. But they aren’t expressing to the world at\nlarge, they are expressing to a social media platform, a business, and so only\nthe most lucrative of voices are heard.\nSo much for not wanting to talk about social media.\nWeb 3.0\nThe new hot topic in crypto and hacker circles is “Web 3.0”, or the\ndecentralized web (dweb). The idea is that we can have all the good of the\ncurrent web (the accessibility, utility, permanency, etc) without all the bad\n(the centralized platforms, censorship, advertising, etc). The way forward to\nthis utopian dream is by building decentralized applications (dApps).\ndApps are constructed in a way where all the users of an application help to\nhost all the stateful content of that application. If I, as a user, post an\nimage to a dApp, the idea is that other users of that same dApp would lend their\nmeager computer resources to ensure my image is never forgotten, and in turn I\nwould lend mine for theirs.\nIn practice building successful dApps is enormously difficult for many reasons,\nand really I’m not sure there are any successful ones (to date). While I\nsupport the general sentiment behind them, I sometimes wonder about the\nefficacy. What people want from the web is a place they can call their own, a\nplace from which they can express themselves and share their contributions with\nothers with all the speed and pervasiveness that the internet offers. A dApp is\njust another walled garden with specific capabilities; it offers only free\nhosting, not free expression.\nWeb 2.0b\nI’m not here solely to complain (just mostly).\nThinking back to Web 1.0, and specifically to the turning point between 1.0 and\n2.0, I’d like to propose that maybe we made a wrong turn. The issue at hand was\nthat hosting one’s own site was still too much of a technical burden, and the\ndirection we went was towards having businesses host them for us. Perhaps there\nwas another way.\nWhat are the specific difficulties with hosting one’s own site? Here are the\nones I can think of:\n\n  \n    Bad tooling: basically none of the tools you’re required to use (web server,\nTLS, DNS, your home router) are designed for the average person.\n  \n  \n    Aggregiously complex languages: making a site which looks half decent and can\ndo the things you want requires a lot of knowledge about the underlying\nlanguages (CSS, HTML, Javascript, and whatever your server is written in).\n  \n  \n    Single point-of-failure: if your machine is off, your site is down.\n  \n  \n    Security: it’s important to stay ahead of the hackers, but it takes time to\ndo so.\n  \n  \n    Hostile environment: this is separate from security, and includes difficulties\nlike dynamic home IPs and bad ISP policies (such as asymetric upload/download\nspeeds).\n  \n\nThese are each separate avenues of attack.\nBad tooling is a result of the fact that devs generally build technology for\nthemselves or their fellow devs, and only build for others when they’re being\npaid to do it. This is merely an attitude problem.\nComplex languages are really a sub-category of bad tooling. The concesus seems\nto be that the average person isn’t interested or capable of working in\nHTML/CSS/JS. This may be true today, but it wasn’t always. Most of my friends in\nmiddle and high school were well within their interest and capability to create\nthe most heinous MySpace pages the world has ever seen, using nothing but CSS\ngenerators and scraps of shitty JS they found lying around. So what changed? The\ntools we use to build those pages did.\nA hostile environment is not something any individual can do anything about, but\nin the capitalist system we exist in we can at least hold in faith the idea that\neventually us customers will get what we want. It may take a long time, but all\nmonopolies break eventually, and someone will eventually sell us the internet\naccess we’re asking for. If all other pieces are in place I think we’ll have\nenough people asking to make a difference.\nFor single point-of-failure we have to grant that more than one person will be\ninvolved, since the vast majority of people aren’t going to be able to keep one\nmachine online consistently, let alone two or more machines. But I think we all\nknow at least one person who could keep a machine online with some reliability,\nand they probably know a couple of other people who could do so as well. What\nI’m proposing is that, rather than building tools for global decentralization,\nwe need tools for local decentralization, aka federation. We can make it\npossible for a group of people to have their presence managed by a subset of\nthemselves. Those with the ability could help to host the online presence of\ntheir family, friends, churches, etc, if given the right tools.\nSecurity is the hard one, but also in many ways isn’t. What most people want\nfrom the web is a place from which to express themselves. Expression doesn’t\ntake much more than a static page, usually, and there’s not much attacking one\ncan do against a static page. Additionally, we’ve already established that\nthere’s going to be at least a couple of technically minded people involved in\nhosting this thing.\nSo that’s my idea that I’d like to build towards. First among these ideas is\nthat we need tools which can help people help each other host their content, and\non top of that foundation a new web can be built which values honest expression\nrather than the lucrative madness which our current algorithms love so much.\nThis project was already somewhat started by\nCryptorado while I\nwas a regular attendee, but since COVID started my attendance has fallen off.\nHopefully one day it can resume. In the meantime I’m going to be working on\nsetting up these tools for myself, and see how far I can get.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-the-web/","title":"The Web"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-trading-in-the-rain/":{"body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each pair listed below, live trade data will be pulled down from the\nCryptowat.ch Websocket\nAPI and used to generate musical rain drops.

A point may be alive (filled)\nor dead (empty).\n  \n  \n    On every tick each live point picks from 0 to N new points to spawn, where N is\nthe number of empty adjacent points to it. If it picks 0, it becomes dead.\n  \n  \n    Each line indicates the parent of a point. Lines have an arbitrary lifetime of\na few ticks, and occupy the points they connect (so new points may not spawn\non top of a line).\n  \n  \n    When a dead point has no lines it is cleaned up, and its point is no longer\noccupied.\n  \n\nThe resulting behavior is somewhere between Conway’s Game of\nLife and white noise.\nThough each point operates independently, they tend to move together in groups.\nWhen two groups collide head on they tend to cancel each other out, killing most\nof both. When they meet while both heading in a common direction they tend to\npeacefully merge towards that direction.\nSometimes their world becomes so cluttered there’s hardly room to move.\nSometimes a major coincidence of events leads to multiple groups canceling each\nother at once, opening up the world and allowing for an explosion of new growth.\nSome groups spiral about a single point, sustaining themselves and defending\nfrom outside groups in the same movement. This doesn’t last for very long.\nThe performance of this visualization is not very optimized, and will probably\neat up your CPU like nothing else. Most of the slowness comes from drawing the\nlines; since there’s so many individual small ones it’s quite cumbersome to do.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-visualization-1/","title":"Visualization 1"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-visualization-2/":{"body":"\n\n\n\nThis visualization builds on the previous. Structurally the cartesian grid has\nbeen turned into an isometric one, but this is more of an environmental change\nthan a behavioral one.\nBehavioral changes which were made:\n\n  \n    When a live point is deciding its next spawn points, it first sorts the set of\nempty adjacent points from closest-to-the-center to farthest. It then chooses\na number n between 0 to N (where N is the sorted set’s size) and\nspawns new points from the first n points of the sorted set. n is chosen\nbased on:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;The live point’s linear distance from the center.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;A random multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n  \n    Each point is spawned with an attached color, where the color chosen is a\nslightly different hue than its parent. The change is deterministic, so all\nchild points of the same generation have the same color.\n  \n\nThe second change is purely cosmetic, but does create a mesmerizing effect. The\nfirst change alters the behavior dramatically. Only the points which compete for\nthe center are able to reproduce, but by the same token are more likely to be\nstarved out by other points doing the same.\nIn the previous visualization the points moved around in groups aimlessly. Now\nthe groups are all competing for the same thing, the center. As a result they\ncongregate and are able to be viewed as a larger whole.\nThe constant churn of the whole takes many forms, from a spiral in the center,\nto waves crashing against each other, to outright chaos, to random purges of\nnearly all points.

The “Layer Neighbor Likeness Scalar” adjusts the lifetime of elements\nbased on how like they are to nearby elements on the neighboring layer.\nBy default, the top layer has a high affinity for the bottom’s color, but the\nbottom doesn’t care about the top’s color at all (and so its color will drift\naimlessly).\nAnd finally “Color Drift” can be used to adjust the degree to which the color of\nnew elements can diverge from its parents. This has always been hardcoded, but\ncan now be adjusted separately across the different layers.\nIn the default configuration the top layer will (eventually) converge to roughly\nmatch the bottom both in shape and color. When I first implemented the likeness\nscaling I thought it was broken, because the top would never converge to the\nbottom’s color.\nWhat I eventually realized was that the top must have a higher color drift than\nthe bottom in order for it to do so, otherwise the top would always be playing\ncatchup. However, if the drift difference is too high then the top layer\nbecomes chaos and also doesn’t really follow the color of the bottom. A\ndifference of 10 (degrees out of 360) is seemingly enough.\n\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/brian-picciano-visualization-7/","title":"Visualization 7"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-an-intro-to-functional-reactive-programming-in-uis/":{"body":"Maybe you've heard of React, Om,\nor Elm, and wondering: what's the deal with\nfunctional reactive programming (FRP)?\nThis post will act as primer on FRP using vanilla JS, but the ideas presented\nhere translate pretty easily in any language and UI system.\nSo let's start with an informal, pragmatic definition of FRP:\n\nUse streams of data to create the application state (data)\n\nAnd\n\nBuild a UI given only the application state with pure functions (view)\n\nStreams and arrays\nYou can imagine streams of data as a set of values over time.\nA stream of numbers representing a counter would look like:\n[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...]\n\nEach number is essentially a snapshot of the value at that time.\nStreams are similar to arrays, but the main difference is time.\nAn immutable array has all the values it will ever have when it is created, while a stream represents all the values that have happened and will\nhappen.\nHere's a concrete example: You are an owner of an exclusive restaurant.\nIt's so exclusive that people have to make reservations months in advance.\nEvery night you have a list of people at your restaurant (because they've\nalready made reservations). Imagine the list being [amy, sally, bob].\nTo count the number of guests, we would just reduce over the list\nadding 1 for every guest. If we wanted to know how much each guest spent\nwe would map against a function that tells us the guest's bill.\nThis is just a normal array with normal map/reduce construct.\nFor completeness here's the equivalent code.\nvar guests = [\"amy\", \"sally\", \"bob\"];\nvar bills = { amy: 22.5, sally: 67.0, bob: 6.0 };\n// Count the guests\nguests.reduce(function(sum, guest) {\nreturn sum + 1;\n}, 0);\n// =&gt; 3\n// Get the bills\nguests.map(function(guest) {\nreturn bills[guest];\n});\n// =&gt; [22.5, 67, 6]\n\nUnfortunately Sally had some bad fish and died after eating at your\nrestaurant, so everyone has cancelled their reservations and you are\nnow a fast food place. In this case you don't have a list of guests,\ninstead you have a stream of people who come in and order food.\nFrank might come in at 10 am, followed by Jack at 2 pm. To get\nsimilar data as before we would again map/reduce over the stream,\nbut since we are operating over a stream that never ends, the values\nfrom map/reduce themselves become streams that never end.\nHere is some equivalent pseudo code for streams that calculates\nthe guestCounts and the guestBills.\nguests      = [... time passes ..., Frank, ... time passes ..., Jack, ... ]\nguestCounts = [... time passes ..., 1,     ... time passes ..., 2, ... ]\nguestBills =  [... time passes ..., 5.50,  ... time passes ..., 6.50, ... ]\n\nSo a stream is just like an array that never ends, and represents\nsnapshots of time.\nNow that we have an intuitive idea what streams are, we can actually\nimplement them.\nStreams of data\nA stream of numbers representing a counter would look like:\n[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...]\n\nIf we wanted to keep track of how long someone was on our page,\nwe could just display the latest value of the counter stream\nin our UI and that would be enough.\nA more involved example: Imagine we had a stream of data\nthat represents the keys pressed on the keyboard.\n[\"p\",\"w\",\"n\",\"2\",\"o\",\"w\",\"n\",...]\n\nNow we want to have a stream that represents the state of the system,\nsay the amount of keys pressed.\nOur key count stream would look like:\n[\"p\",\"w\",\"n\",\"2\",\"o\",\"w\",\"n\",...]\n=&gt;\n[ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7, ...]\n\nThis transformation would happen with a reducing function.\nvar keyCountReducer = function(reducedValue, streamSnapshot) {\n  return reducedValue + 1;\n};\n\nThis function takes in the stream value, and a reduced value so far, and\nreturns a new reduced value. In this case a simple increment.\nWe've talked about streams for a while now, let's implement them.\nIn the following code, we create a function that will return an object with two\nmethods: observe for registering event listeners and update for adding a value\nto the stream.\n// A function to make streams for us\nvar streamMaker = function() {\n  var registeredListeners = [];\n  return {\n    // Have an observe function, so\n    // people who are interested can\n    // get notified when there is an update\n    observe: function(callback) {\n      registeredListeners.push(callback);\n    },\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;// Add a value to this stream\n// Once added, will notify all\n// interested parties\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#8fa1b3;\"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(value) {\n  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;registeredListeners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(cb) {\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;cb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;);\n  });\n}\n\n};\n};\n\nWe also want to make a helper function that will create a new reduced stream\ngiven an existing stream, a reducingFunction, and an initialReducedValue:\n// A function to make a new stream from an existing stream\n// a reducing function, and an initial reduced value\nvar reducedStream = function(stream, reducingFunction, initialReducedValue) {\n  var newStream = streamMaker();\n  var reducedValue = initialReducedValue;\nstream.observe(function(streamSnapshotValue) {\nreducedValue = reducingFunction(reducedValue, streamSnapshotValue);\nnewStream.update(reducedValue);\n});\nreturn newStream;\n};\n\nNow to implement the keypress stream and count stream.\n// Our reducer from before\nvar keyCountReducer = function(reducedValue, streamSnapshot) {\n  return reducedValue + 1;\n};\n// Create the keypress stream\nvar keypressStream = streamMaker();\n// an observer will have that side effect of printing out to the console\nkeypressStream.observe(function(v) {\nconsole.log(\"key: \", v);\n});\n// Whenever we press a key, we'll update the stream to be the char code.\ndocument.onkeypress = function(e) {\nkeypressStream.update(String.fromCharCode(e.charCode));\n};\n// Using our reducedStream helper function we can make a new stream\n// That reduces the keypresses into a stream of key counts\nvar countStream = reducedStream(keypressStream, keyCountReducer, 0);\ncountStream.observe(function(v) {\nconsole.log(\"Count: \", v);\n});\n\nNow with the new stream we can display it like we did before.\nWhich leads us into our next point...\nRendering UIs given data\nNow that we have a system for generating state through streams,\nlet's actually show something off.\nThis is where React.js shines, but for the purpose of this post we'll\nbuild our own system.\nLet's say at one point in time our data looks like:\n{\"Count\":1}\n\nAnd we want to render a UI that represents this information.\nSo we'll write a simple piece of JS that renders html directly from the map.\nTo keep it easy, we'll use the keys as div ids.\n//Pure Function to create the dom nodes\nvar createDOMNode = function(key, dataMapOrValue) {\n  var div = document.createElement(\"div\");\n  div.setAttribute(\"id\", key);\n// Recurse for children\nif (typeof dataMapOrValue === \"object\" &amp;&amp; dataMapOrValue !== null) {\nObject.keys(dataMapOrValue).forEach(function(childKey) {\nvar child = createDOMNode(childKey, dataMapOrValue[childKey]);\ndiv.appendChild(child);\n});\n} else {\n// There are no children just a value.\n// We set the data to be the content of the node\n// Note this does not protect against XSS\ndiv.innerHTML = dataMapOrValue;\n}\nreturn div;\n};\n// Render Data\nvar render = function(rootID, appState) {\nvar root;\n// Check if the root id is even defined\nif (document.getElementById(rootID) === null) {\n// We need to add this root id so we can use it later\nroot = document.createElement(\"div\");\nroot.setAttribute(\"id\", rootID);\ndocument.body.appendChild(root);\n}\nroot = document.getElementById(rootID);\n// Clear all the existing content in the page\nroot.innerHTML = \"\";\n// render the appState back in\nroot.appendChild(createDOMNode(rootID, appState));\n};\nrender(\"counter\", { Count: 1 });\n\nAfter running this code on a blank page we have a page\nthat says 1, it worked!\nA bit boring though, how about we make it a bit more interesting by updating\non the stream.\nRendering Streams of data\nWe've figured out how streams work, how to work with streams, and how to\nrender a page given some data. Now we'll tie all the parts together; render\nthe stream as it changes over time.\nIt really is simple. All we have to do is re-render whenever we receive\na new value on the stream.\n// Let's observe the countstream and render when we get an update\ncountStream.observe(function(value) {\n  render(\"counter\", value);\n});\n// And if we wanted to render what the keypress stream tells us, we can do so\n// just as easily\nkeypressStream.observe(function(value) {\nrender(\"keypress\", value);\n});\nSingle App State\nA single app state means that there is only one object that encapsulates the\nstate of your application.\nBenefits:\n\nAll changes to the frontend happen from this app state.\nYou can snapshot this state and be able to recreate the\nfrontend at any point in time (facilitates undo/redo).\n\nDownsides:\n\nYou may conflate things that shouldn't be together.\n\nHaving a single place that reflects the whole state is pretty amazing,\nhow often have you had your app get messed up because of some rogue event?\nor hidden state affecting the application, or an ever growing state\nscattered around the application.\nNo more.\nA single app state is a natural end to the directed acyclic graph that\nwe've created with streams.\nstream1 -&gt; mappedStream\n                        \\\n                         mergedStream -&gt; appStateStream\n                        /\nstream2 -&gt; reducedStream\nImplementing Single App State\nIn our previous example we had two pieces of state,\nthe counter and the keypress. We could merge these together into one stream, and\nthen form a single app state from that stream.\nFirst let's make a helper function that will merge streams for us. To keep it\ngeneral and simple we'll take only two streams and a merging function.\nIt will return a new stream which is the merge of both streams with the mergeFn.\n// A merge streams helper function\nvar mergeStreams = function(streamA, streamB, mergeFn) {\n  var streamData = [null, null];\n  var newStream = streamMaker();\nstreamA.observe(function(value) {\nstreamData[0] = value;\nnewStream.update(mergeFn.apply(null, streamData));\n});\nstreamB.observe(function(value) {\nstreamData[1] = value;\nnewStream.update(mergeFn.apply(null, streamData));\n});\nreturn newStream;\n};\n\nThis implementation will call the merge function with the latest value from the\nstreams or null if the stream hasn't emitted anything yet. This means the output\ncan return duplicate values of one of the streams.\n(As a side note, the performance impact of duplicate values can be mitigated\nwith immutable datastructures)\nWe want to put both the keypress and the counter in one object, so our\nmerge function will do just that.\nvar mergeIntoObject = function(keypress, counter) {\n  return { counter: counter, keypress: keypress };\n};\n\nNow to create the single app state stream, and render that single app state.\nvar appStateStream = mergeStreams(keypressStream, countStream, mergeIntoObject);\nappStateStream.observe(function(value) {\nrender(\"app\", value);\n});\nFinal Code\nMost of these functions are library functions that you wouldn't need to implement\nyourself. The final application specific code would look like:\n// Create the keypress stream\nvar keypressStream = streamMaker();\n// Whenever we press a key, we'll update the stream to be the char code.\ndocument.onkeypress = function(e) {\nkeypressStream.update(String.fromCharCode(e.charCode));\n};\nvar keyCountReducer = function(reducedValue, streamSnapshot) {\nreturn reducedValue + 1;\n};\n// Using our reducedStream helper function we can make a new stream\n// That reduces the keypresses into a stream of key counts\nvar countStream = reducedStream(keypressStream, keyCountReducer, 0);\nvar mergeIntoObject = function(keypress, counter) {\nreturn { counter: counter, keypress: keypress };\n};\nvar appStateStream = mergeStreams(keypressStream, countStream, mergeIntoObject);\nappStateStream.observe(function(value) {\nrender(\"app\", value);\n});\n\nYou can see a running version of this code here\nThe render, a closer look\nSo what does the render actually do?\nWell, it clears the inner html of a containing div and adds an element inside of it.\nBut that's pretty standard, how are we defining what element is created?\nWhy yes, it's the createDOMNode function. In fact, if you wanted your data displayed\ndifferently (e.g. in color, or upside down) all you'd have to do is write your own\ncreateDOMNode function that adds the necessary styles or elements.\nEssentially, the createDOMNode function controls what your UI will look like.\ncreateDOMNode is a pure function, meaning for the same set of inputs, you'll\nalways get the same set of outputs, and has no side effects (like an api call).\nThis wasn't a happy accident, FRP leads to a\ndesign where the functions which build your UI are pure functions!\nThis means UI components are significantly easier to reason about.\nTime travel\nOften when people talk about FRP, time travel is bound to get brought up.\nSpecifically the ability to undo and redo the state of your UI. Hopefully, if\nyou've gotten this far, you can see how trivial it would be to store the data\nused to render the UIs in an array and just move forward and backward to\nimplement redo and undo.\nPerformance\nIf you care about performance in the slightest, you probably shuddered when\nI nuked the containing element and recreated all the children nodes. I don't\nblame you; however, that is an implementation detail. While my implementation\nis slow, there are implementations (e.g. React) that only update the items and\nattributes that have changed, thus reaping performance benefits with no cost\nto the programmer! You are getting a better system for modeling UIs and\nthe performance boosts for free! Furthermore a lot of smart people are working\non React, and as it gets faster, so will your app. Without any effort on your\npart.\nNow with actual libraries\nA lot of what we wrote was the library to get streams up and running,\nhowever those already exists (e.g. Bacon.js and React.js)\nA couple quick notes if this is your first time looking at React.js or Bacon.js.\ngetInitialState defines the initial local state of the component.\ncomponentWillMount is a function that gets called before the component\nis placed on the DOM.\n&lt;stream&gt;.scan is our reducing function in Bacon.js parlance.\n// Our streams just like before\nvar keypressStream = Bacon.fromEventTarget(document.body, \"keypress\").map(\n  function(e) {\n    return String.fromCharCode(e.charCode);\n  }\n);\nvar countStream = keypressStream.scan(0, function(count, key) {\nreturn count + 1;\n});\nvar KeyPressComponent = React.createClass({\ngetInitialState: function() {\nreturn { count: 0, keypress: \"&lt;press a key&gt;\", totalWords: \"\" };\n},\ncomponentWillMount: function() {\nthis.props.countStream.onValue(\nfunction(count) {\nthis.setState({ count: count });\n}.bind(this)\n);\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.props.keypressStream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;onValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(\n  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(key) {\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;({ keypress: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;key &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;});\n  }.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;)\n);\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;// Add something extra because why not\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.props.keypressStream\n  .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(&amp;quot;&amp;quot;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(totalWords, key) {\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;return &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;totalWords &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;+ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;;\n  })\n  .&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;onValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(totalWords) {\n      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;({ totalWords: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;totalWords &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;});\n    }.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;)\n  );\n\n},\nrender: function() {\nreturn React.DOM.div(\nnull,\nReact.createElement(\"h1\", null, \"Count: \" + this.state.count),\nReact.createElement(\"h1\", null, \"Keypress: \" + this.state.keypress),\nReact.createElement(\"h1\", null, \"Total words: \" + this.state.totalWords)\n);\n}\n});\nReact.render(\nReact.createElement(KeyPressComponent, {\nkeypressStream: keypressStream,\ncountStream: countStream\n}),\ndocument.body\n);\n\njsfiddle for this code here.\nClosing Notes\nReact is great for reactively rendering the ui.\nBacon.js is a great library that implements these streams.\nIf you're looking to really delve into FRP:\nElm has a well thought out FRP system in a haskell like language.\nIf you're feeling adventurous give Om &amp; Clojurescript a shot.\nOm is a great tool that adds immutability\nto React, and brings React to Clojurescript\nFinally, Evan Czaplicki (Elm creator) did a great talk on FRP\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-an-intro-to-functional-reactive-programming-in-uis/","title":"An Intro to Functional Reactive Programming in UIs"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-backups-made-simple/":{"body":"I've made a backup system I can be proud of, and I'd like to share it with you\ntoday. It follows a philosophy I've been fleshing out called The\nFunctional Infra. Concretely it aims to:\n\nBe pure. An output should only be a function of its inputs.\nBe declarative and reproducible. A by product of being pure.\nSupport rollbacks. Also a by product of being pure.\nSurface actionable errors. The corollary being it should be easy to understand\nand observe what is happening.\n\nAt a high level, the backup system works like so:\n\nZFS creates automatic snapshots every so often.\nThose snapshots are replicated to an EBS-backed EC2 instance that is only\nalive while backup replication is happening. Taking advantage of ZFS'\nincremental snapshot to make replication generally quite fast.\nThe EBS drive itself stays around after the instance is terminated. This\ndrive is a Cold HDD (sc1) which costs about $0.015 gb/month.\n\nZFS\nTo be honest I haven't used ZFS all that much, but that's kind of my point. I,\nas a non-expert in ZFS, have been able to get a lot out of it just by\nfollowing the straightforward documentation. It seems like the API is well\nthought out and the semantics are reasonable. For example, a consistent snapshot\nis as easy as doing zfs snapshot tank/home/marco@friday.\nAutomatic snapshots\nOn NixOS setting up automatic snapshots is a breeze, just add the following to\nyour NixOS Configuration:\n{\n  services.zfs.autoSnapshot.enable = true;\n}\n\nand setting the com.sun:auto-snapshot option on the filesystem. E.g.: zfs set com.sun:auto-snapshot=true &lt;pool&gt;/&lt;fs&gt;. Note that this can also be done on\ncreation of the filesystem: zfs create -o mountpoint=legacy -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=true tank/home.\nWith that enabled, ZFS will keep a snapshot for the latest 4 15-minute, 24\nhourly, 7 daily, 4 weekly and 12 monthly snapshots.\nOn Demand EC2 Instance for Backups\nNow that we've demonstrated how to setup snapshotting, we need to tackle the\nproblem of replicating those snapshots somewhere so we can have real backups.\nFor that I use one of my favorite little tools:\nlazyssh. Its humble description betrays\nlittle information at its true usefulness. The description is simply:\nA jump-host SSH server that starts machines on-demand. What it enables is\npretty magical. It essentially lets you run arbitrary code when something SSHs\nthrough the jump-host.\nLet's take the classic ZFS replication example from the\ndocs:\nhost1# zfs send tank/dana@snap1 | ssh host2 zfs recv newtank/dana. This\ncommand copies a snapshot from a machine named host1 to another machine named\nhost2 over SSH. Simple and secure backups. But it relies on host2 being\navailable. With lazyssh we can make host2 only exist when needed.\nhost2 would start when the ssh command is invoked and terminated when the ssh\ncommand finishes. The command with lazyssh would look something like this\n(assuming you have a lazyssh target in your .ssh/config as explained in the\ndocs):\nhost1# zfs send tank/dana@snap1 | ssh -J lazyssh host2 zfs recv newtank/dana\n\nNote the only difference is the -J lazyssh.\nSo how do we actually setup lazyssh to do this? Here is my configuration:\n\n    \n\nNote there are a couple of setup steps:\n\nCreate the initial sc1 EBS Drive. I did this in the AWS Console, but you\ncould do this in Terraform or the AWS CLI.\nCreate the ZFS pool on the drive. I launched my lazy archiver without the ZFS\nfilesystem option and ran: zpool create -o ashift=12 -O mountpoint=none POOL_NAME /dev/DRIVE_LOCATION. Then I created the\nPOOL_NAME/backup dataset with zfs create -o acltype=posixacl -o xattr=sa -o mountpoint=legacy POOL_NAME/backup.\n\nAs a quality of life and security improvement I setup\nhomemanager to manage my SSH\nconfig and known_hosts file so these are automatically correct and properly\nsetup. I generate the lines for known_hosts when I generate the host keys\nthat go in the user_data field in the lazsyssh-config.hcl above. Here's the\nrelevant section from my homemanager config:\n{\n  programs.ssh = {\n    enable = true;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;# I keep this file tracked in Git alongside my NixOS configs.\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;userKnownHostsFile &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;/path/to/known_hosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;matchBlocks &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= {\n  &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;archiver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot; = {\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;user &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;root&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;hostname &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;archiver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;proxyJump &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;lazyssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;identityFile &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;PATH_TO_AWS_KEYPAIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n  };\n\n  &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;lazyssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot; = {\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;# This assume you are running lazyssh locally, but it can also\n    # reference another machine.\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;hostname &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;localhost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;port &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;7922&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;user &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;jump&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;identityFile &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;PATH_TO_LAZYSSH_CLIENT_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;identitiesOnly &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;;\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;extraOptions &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= {\n      &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;PreferredAuthentications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot; = &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;publickey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n    };\n  };\n};\n\n};\n}\n\nFinally, I use the provided NixOS Module for lazyssh to manage starting it and\nkeeping it up. Here's the relevant parts from my flake.nix:\n{\n  # My fork that supports placements and terminating instances after failing to\n  # attach volume.\n  inputs.lazyssh.url = \"github:marcopolo/lazyssh/attach-volumes\";\n  inputs.lazyssh.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\";\noutputs =\n{ self\n, nixpkgs\n, lazyssh\n}: {\n  nixosConfigurations = {\n\n    nixMachineHostName = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {\n      system = &amp;quot;x86_64-linux&amp;quot;;\n      modules = [\n          {\n            imports = [lazyssh.nixosModule]\n            services.lazyssh.configFile =\n              &amp;quot;/path/to/lazyssh-config.hcl&amp;quot;;\n            # You&amp;#39;ll need to add the correct AWS credentials to `/home/lazyssh/.aws`\n            # This could probably be a symlink with home-manager to a\n            # managed file somewhere else, but I haven&amp;#39;t go down that path\n            # yet\n            users.users.lazyssh = {\n              isNormalUser = true;\n              createHome = true;\n            };\n          }\n      ];\n    };\n  };\n}\n\n}\n\nWith all that setup, I can ssh into the archiver by simple running ssh archiver. Under the hood, lazyssh starts the EC2 instance and attaches the\nEBS drive to it. And since ssh archiver works, so does the original example\nof: zfs send tank/dana@snap1 | ssh archiver zfs recv newtank/dana.\nAutomatic Replication\nThe next part of the puzzle is to have backups happen automatically. There are\nvarious tools you can use for this. Even a simple cron that runs the send/recv\non a schedule. I opted to go for what NixOS supports out of the box, which is\nhttps://github.com/alunduil/zfs-replicate.\nUnfortunately, I ran into a couple issues that led me to make a fork. Namely:\n\nUsing /usr/bin/env - ssh fails to use the ssh config file. My fork supports\nspecifying a custom ssh binary to use.\nSupport for ExecStartPre. This is to \"warm up\" the archiver instance. I run\nnixos-rebuild switch which is basically a no-op if there is no changes to\napply from the configuration file, or blocks until the changes have been\napplied. In my case these are usually the changes inside the UserData field.\nSupport for ExecStopPost. This is to add observability to this process.\nI wanted to raise the systemd timeout limit. In case the ExecStartPre takes\na while to warm-up the instance.\n\nThankfully with flakes, using my own fork was painless. Here's the relevant\nsection from my flake.nix file:\n  # inputs.zfs-replicate.url = \"github:marcopolo/zfs-replicate/flake\";\n  # ...\n  # Inside nixosSystem modules...\n  ({ pkgs, ... }:\n    {\n      imports = [ zfs-replicate.nixosModule ];\n      # Disable the existing module\n      disabledModules = [ \"services/backup/zfs-replication.nix\" ];\n  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;services&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;zfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;autoReplication &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;=\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;let\n      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;host &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;archiver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;sshPath &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#ab7967;\"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#bf616a;\"&gt;pkgs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#bf616a;\"&gt;openssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#ab7967;\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;/bin/ssh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;&amp;quot;;\n      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;# Make sure the machine is up-to-date\n      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#d08770;\"&gt;execStartPre &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#c0c5ce;\"&gt;= &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#ab7967;\"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#bf616a;\"&gt;sshPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#ab7967;\"&gt;} ${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#bf616a;\"&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-style:italic;color:#ab7967;\"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#a3be8c;\"&gt;

It also\nreports the result of the replication to\nHoneycomb, which brings us to our next\nsection...\nObservability\nThe crux of any automated process is it failing silently. This is especially bad\nin the context of backups, since you don't need them until you do. I solved this\nby reporting the result of the replication to Honeycomb after every run. It\nreports the $SERVICE_RESULT, $EXIT_CODE and $EXIT_STATUS as returned by\nsystemd. I then create an alert that fires if there are no successful runs in\nthe past hour.\nFuture Work\nWhile I like this system for being simple, I think there is a bit more work in\nmaking it pure. For one, there should be no more than 1 manual step for setup,\nand 1 manual step for tear down. There should also be a similar simplicity in\nupgrading/downgrading storage space.\nFor reliability, the archiver instance should scrub its drive on a schedule.\nThis isn't setup yet.\nAt $0.015 gb/month this is relatively cheap, but not the cheapest. According to\nfilstats I could use\nFilecoin to store data for much less. There's no\nBlock Device interface to this yet, so it wouldn't be as simple as ZFS\nsend/recv. You'd lose the benefits of incremental snapshots. But it may be\npossible to build a block device interface on top. Maybe with an nbd-server?\nExtra\nBits and pieces that may be helpful if you try setting something similar up.\nSetting host key and Nix Configuration with UserData\nNixOS on AWS has this undocumented nifty feature of setting the ssh host\nkey and a new configuration.nix file straight from the UserData\nfield.\nThis lets you one, be sure that your SSH connection isn't being\nMITM, and two, configure\nthe machine in a simple way. I use this feature to set the SSH host key and set\nthe machine up with ZFS and the the lz4 compression package.\nQuestions? Comments?\nEmail me if you set this system up. This is purposely not a tutorial, so you may\nhit snags. If you think something could be clearer feel free to make an\nedit.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-backups-made-simple/","title":"Backups made simple"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-bart-facts/":{"body":"Click Here\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-bart-facts/","title":"Bart Facts"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-declarative-dev-environments/":{"body":"I don't install development tools globally. I don't have node added to my\nPATH in my ~/.zshrc file, and running cargo outside a project folder\nreturns \"command not found.\" I wipe my computer on every reboot. With the\nexception of four folders (/boot, /nix, /home, and /persist), everything\ngets deleted. And it has worked\nout great.\nInstead of installing development packages globally, I declare them as a\ndependency in my project's dev environment. They become available as soon as I\ncd into the project folder. If two projects use the same tool then I only keep\none version of that tool on my computer.\nI think installing dev tools globally is a bad pattern that leads to nothing but\nheartache and woe. If you are running sudo apt-get install or brew install\nprior to building a project, you are doing it wrong. By defining your dev tool\ndependencies explicitly you allow your projects to easily build on any\nmachine at any point in time. Whether it's on a friends machine today, or a new\nlaptop in 10 years. It even makes CI integration a breeze.\nWhat do I mean by a declarative dev environment?\nI mean a project that has a special file (or files) that define all the\ndependencies required to build and run your project. It doesn't necessarily have\nto include the actual binaries you will run in the repo, but it should be\nreproducible. If you clone my project you should be running the exact\nsame tools as me.\nJust like you have explicit dependencies on libraries you use in your program, a\ndeclarative dev environment lets you define your tooling dependencies (e.g.\nwhich version of Node, Yarn, or your specific cross compiler toolchain).\nHow I setup my declarative dev environments\nTo accomplish this I use Nix with Nix Flakes and direnv. There are three\nrelevant files: flake.nix which defines the build of the project and the tools\nI need for development; flake.lock which is similar in spirit to a yarn.lock\nor Cargo.lock file, it locks the exact version of any tool used and\ngenerated automatically the first time you introduce dependencies; and finally a\n.envrc file which simply tells direnv to ask Nix what the environment should\nbe, and sets up the environment when you cd into the folder. Here are some\nsimple examples:\nflake.nix,\n.envrc\n(flake.lock omitted since it's automatically generated).\nAs a shortcut for setting up a flake.nix and .envrc, you can use a template\nto provide the boilerplate. When I start a new project I'll run nix flake init -t github:marcopolo/templates which copies the files from this\nrepo and puts them\nin your current working directory. Then running direnv allow will setup your\nlocal environment, installing any missing dependencies through Nix as a side\neffect.\nThis blog itself makes use of declarative dev\nenvironments.\nZola is the static site generator I use. When I cd into my blog my environment\nis automatically setup with Zola available for previewing the blog.\nHow Nix works, roughly\nThis all works off Nix. Nix is a fantastic package manager and build tool that\nprovides reproducible versions of packages that don't rely on a specific global\nsystem configuration. Specifically packages installed through Nix don't rely an\na user's /usr/lib or anything outside of /nix/store. You don't even need\nglibc installed (as may be the case if you are on Alpine\nLinux).\nFor a deeper dive see How Nix Works.\nAn example, how to setup a Yarn based JS project.\nTo be concrete, let me show an example. If I wanted to start a JS project and\nuse Yarn as my dependency manager, I would do something\nlike this: \n# 1. Create the project folder\nmkdir my-project\n# 2. Add the boilerplate files.\nnix flake init -t github:marcopolo/templates\n# 3. Edit flake.nix file to add yarn and NodeJS.\nWith your text editor apply this diff: \n\n-          buildInputs = [ pkgs.hello ]; \n\n+          buildInputs = [ pkgs.yarn pkgs.nodejs-12_x ]; \n\n4. Allow direnv to run this environment. This will also fetch yarn with Nix \n\nand add it to your path. \n\ndirenv allow\n# 5. Yarn is now available, proceed as normal. \nyarn init\n\nYou can simplify this further by making a Nix Flake template that already has\nYarn and NodeJS included. \nAnother example. Setting up a Rust project.\n# 1. Create the project folder\nmkdir rust-project\n# 2. Add the boilerplate files.\nnix flake init -t github:marcopolo/templates#rust\n# 3. Cargo and rust is now available, proceed as normal. \ncargo init\ncargo run\n\nHere we used a Rust specific template, so no post template init changes were required.\nDissecting the flake.nix file\nLet's break down the flake.nix file so we can understand what it is we are\ndeclaring.\nFirst off, the file is written in Nix, the programming\nlanguage. At a high level you\ncan read this as JSON but with functions. Like JSON it can only represent\nexpressions (you can only have one top level JSON object), unlike JSON you can\nhave functions and variables. \n# This is our top level set expression. Equivalent to the top level JSON object.\n{\n  # These are comments\nHere we are defining a set. This is equivalent to a JSON object. \n\nThe key is description, and the value is the string. \n\ndescription = \"A very basic flake\";\n# You can define nested sets by using a . between key parts.\nThis is equivalent to the JSON object {inputs: {flake-utils: {url: \"github:...\"}}} \n\ninputs.flake-utils.url = \"github:numtide/flake-utils\";\n# Functions are defined with the syntax of param: functionBodyExpression.\nThe param can be destructured if it expects a set, like what we are doing here. \n\nThis defines the output of this flake. Our dev environment will make use of \n\nthe devShell attribute, but you can also define the release build of your \n\npackage here. \n\noutputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:\n# This is a helper to generate these outputs for each system (x86-linux,\n# arm-linux, macOS, ...)\nflake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:\nlet\n# The nixpkgs repo has to know which system we are using.\npkgs = import nixpkgs { system = system; };\nin\n{\n# This is the environment that direnv will use.

I\nclassify Dev Tools as things that need to be available to build or develop a given\nproject specifically. Think of gcc, yarn, or cargo. The Dev Setup category\nare for things that are useful when developing in general. Vim, Emacs,\nag are some examples.\nDev tools are worth defining explicitly in your project's declarative dev environment (in\na flake.nix file). A Dev Setup is highly personal and not worth defining in the\nproject's declarative dev environment. But that's not to say your dev setup in not\nworth defining at all. In fact, if you are (or when you become) familiar with\nNix, you can extend the same ideas of this post to your user account with Home\nManager. \nWith Home Manager You can declaratively define which programs you want available\nin your dev setup, what Vim plugins you want installed, what ZSH plugins you\nwant available and much more. It's the core idea of declarative dev environments\ntaken to the user account level.\nWhy not Docker?\nMany folks use Docker to get something like this, but while it gets close – and\nin some cases functionally equivalent – it has some shortcomings:\nFor one, a Dockerfile is not reproducible out of the box. It is common to use\napt-get install in a Dockerfile to add packages. This part isn't reproducible\nand brings you back to the initial problem I outlined. \nDocker is less effecient with storage. It uses layers as the base block of\nDocker images rather than packages. This means that it's relatively easy to end\nup with many similar docker images (for a more thorough analysis check\nout Optimising Docker Layers for Better Caching with\nNix).\nSpinning up a container and doing development inside may not leverage your\nexisting dev setup. For example you may have Vim setup neatly on your machine,\nbut resort to vi when developing inside a container.  Or worse, you'll \nrebuild your dev setup inside the container, which does nothing more than\nadd dead weight to the container since it's an addition solely for you and not\nreally part of the project. Of course there are some workarounds to this issue,\nyou can bind mount a folder and VS Code supports opening a project inside a\ncontainer.  ZMK does this and it has\nworked great.\nIf you are on MacOS, developing inside a container is actually slower. Docker\non Mac relies on running a linux VM in the background and running containers in\nthat VM. By default that VM is underpowered relative to the host MacOS machine.\nThere are cases where you actually do only want to run the code in an\nx86-linux environment and Docker provides a convenient proxy for this. In these\ncases I'd suggest using Nix to generate the Docker images. This way you get the\ndeclarative and reproducible properties from Nix and the convenience from Docker.\nAs a caveat to all of the above, if you already have a reproducible dev environment\nwith a Docker container that works for you, please don't throw that all out and\nredesign your system from scratch. Keep using it until it stops meeting your\nneeds and come back to this when it happens. Until then, keep building.\nOn Nix Flakes\nNix Flakes is still new and in beta, so it's likely that if you install Nix from\ntheir download page you won't have Nix Flakes\navailable. If you don't already have Nix installed, you can install a version\nwith Nix Flakes with the unstable installer,\notherwise read the section on installing flakes.\nClosing thoughts\nIn modern programming languages we define all our dependencies explicitly and\nlock the specific versions used. It's about time we do that for all our tools\ntoo. Let's get rid of the apt-get install and brew install section of READMEs.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-declarative-dev-environments/","title":"Declarative Dev Environments"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-from-c-to-rust-to-c-again-or-re-exporting-c-exports-in-rust/":{"body":"The only difference between being a grown up and being a kid, in my experience, is as a grown up, you have much fewer people who are willing to play the game telephone with you. Luckily for me, I have access to a computer, a C compiler, and a Rust compiler. Let me show you how I played telephone with Rust &amp; C.\ntl;dr:\n\nRust can't re-export from a linked C library (unless you rename) when compiled as a cdylib.\nLook at this issue\n\nImagine you have some C code that provides add_two. It looks like this:\nint add_two(int n)\n{\n    return n + 2;\n}\n\nAnd you can even let Cargo deal with building your C library by making a build.rs with cc. Like so:\nuse cc;\nfn main() {\ncc::Build::new().file(\"src/c/foo.c\").compile(\"foo\");\n}\n\nNow you want to be able to call add_two from Rust. Easy! You look at the FFI section in the Nomicon. And follow it like so:\n#[link(name = \"foo\", kind = \"static\")]\n#[no_mangle]\nextern \"C\" {\n    pub fn add_two(x: u32) -&gt; u32;\n}\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern \"C\" fn add_one(x: u32) -&gt; u32 {\nlet a = unsafe { add_two(x) };\na - 1\n}\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod tests {\nuse super::*;\n#[test]\nfn it_works() {\nassert_eq!(add_one(2), 3);\nassert_eq!(unsafe { add_two(2) }, 4);\n}\n}\n\nNow for the last chain in our telephone.

The flags in the clang command mean: -l link this library; -L look here for the library.\nWe've built the code, now we can even run it!\n./call_rust\necho $? # Print the return code of our program, hopefully 42\n\nGreat! We've called C from a Rust Library from a C program. But there's a catch. This won't work if you are building a cdylib. There isn't an RFC yet on how to re-export C externs. In the mean time you'll either have to: re-export under a different name, or build a dylib. See this issue: Re-exporting C symbols for cdylib.\nHope this helps.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-from-c-to-rust-to-c-again-or-re-exporting-c-exports-in-rust/","title":"From C to Rust to C again.

It's\ntaken for granted that this photo will be viewable for the indefinite future\n(or as long as we keep a PNG viewer around). But when we think about code,\nmaybe the very same Smalltalk code we took this photo of, it's assumed that\neventually that code will stop running. It'll stop working because of a\nmysterious force known as bit\nrot. Why? It's this truly\ninevitable? Or can we do better?\nWe can do better\nBit rot often manifests in the case where some software A relies on a certain\nconfigured environment. Imagine A relies on a shared library B. As time\nprogresses, the shared library B can (and probably will) be updated\nindependently of A. Thus breaking A. But what if A could say it\nexplicitly depends on version X.Y.Z of B, or even better yet, the version\nof the library that hashes to the value 0xBADCOFFEE. Then you break the\nimplicit dependency of a correctly configured environment. A stops\ndepending on the world being in a certain state. Instead, A\nexplicitly defines what the world it needs should look like.\nEnter Nix\nThis is what Nix gives you. A way to explicitly define\nwhat a piece of software needs to build and run. Here's an example of the\ndefinition on how to build the GNU\nHello program:\nwith (import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {});\nderivation {\n  name = \"hello\";\n  builder = \"${bash}/bin/bash\";\n  args = [ ./builder.sh ];\n  buildInputs = [ gnutar gzip gnumake gcc binutils-unwrapped coreutils gawk gnused gnugrep ];\n  src = ./hello-2.10.tar.gz;\n  system = builtins.currentSystem;\n}\n\nIt's not necessary to explain this code in\ndetail.\nIt's enough to point out that buildInputs defines what the environment should\ncontain (i.e. it should contain gnutar, gzip, gnumake, etc.). And the\nversions of these dependencies are defined by the current version of\n&lt;nixpkgs&gt;. These dependencies can be further pinned (or locked in the\nterminology of some languages like Javascript and Rust) to ensure that this\nprogram will always be built with the same exact versions of its dependencies.\nThis extends to the runtime as well. This means you can run two different\nprograms that each rely on a different glibc. Or to bring it back to our\ninitial example, software A will always run because it will always use the\nsame exact shared library B.\nA concrete example. This will never bit rot.\nTo continue our Smalltalk theme, here's a \"Hello World\" program that, barring a\nfundamental change in how Nix Flakes works, will work forever1 on an x86_64\nlinux machine.\nThe definition of our program, flake.nix\n{\n  inputs.nixpkgs.url = \"github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-20.09\";\n  outputs =\n    { self, nixpkgs }:\n    let\n      pkgs = nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;\n    in\n    {\n      defaultPackage.x86_64-linux = pkgs.writeScriptBin \"hello-smalltalk\" ''\n        ${pkgs.gnu-smalltalk}/bin/gst &lt;&lt;&lt; \"Transcript show: 'Hello World!'.\"\n      '';\n    };\n}\n\nThe pinned version of all our dependencies, flake.lock\n{\n  \"nodes\": {\n    \"nixpkgs\": {\n      \"locked\": {\n        \"lastModified\": 1606669556,\n        \"narHash\": \"sha256-9rlqZ5JwnA6nK04vKhV0s5ndepnWL5hpkaTV1b4ASvk=\",\n        \"owner\": \"NixOS\",\n        \"repo\": \"nixpkgs\",\n        \"rev\": \"ae47c79479a086e96e2977c61e538881913c0c08\",\n        \"type\": \"github\"\n      },\n      \"original\": {\n        \"owner\": \"NixOS\",\n        \"ref\": \"nixos-20.09\",\n        \"repo\": \"nixpkgs\",\n        \"type\": \"github\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"root\": {\n      \"inputs\": {\n        \"nixpkgs\": \"nixpkgs\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"root\": \"root\",\n  \"version\": 7\n}\n\ncopy those files into a directory and run it:\n❯ nix run\nHello World!\nSolid Foundations\nWith Nix, we can make steady forward progress.

The easy reasons are: \"Github is down\", \"A source tarball you need can't be fetched from the internet\", \"x86_64 processors can't be found or emulated\". But what's a weird reason that this may fail in the future? It'll probably be hard to predict, but maybe something like: SHA256 has been broken and criminals and/or pranksters have published malicious packages that match a certain SHA256. So build tools that rely on a deterministic and hard to break hash algorithm like SHA256 (like what Nix does) will no longer be reliable. That would be a funny future.

When I got an\nemail from GitHub saying that my blog repo has a security vulnerability in\none of its Gems, I took the opportunity to switch over to\nZola.\nZola\nZola make more sense to me than Jekyll. I think about my posts in a\nhierarchy. I'd like my source code to match my mental representation. If you\nlook at the source of this blog, you'll see I have 3 folders (code, books,\nlife). In each folder there are relevant posts. I wanted my blog to show the\ncontents folder as different sections. For the life of me I couldn't figure\nout how to do that in Jekyll.

I had to create an\n_index.md file to provide some metadata, but nothing overly verbose.\nI'm not a Jekyll pro...\nOr even really any level past beginner.

I'm sure there are all sorts of tricks and features that Jekyll\ncan do that Zola cannot. I'm Okay with that.

The binding itself is composed of two main parts.\nPart 1.1 - The C++ Binding\nThe binding is a c++ class that implements the jsi::HostObject interface. At the very least it's useful for it to have a get method defined. The type of the get method is:\njsi::Value get(jsi::Runtime &amp;runtime, const jsi::PropNameID &amp;name) override;\n\nIt returns a jsi::Value (a value that is safe for JS). It's given the JS runtime and the prop string used by JS when it gets the field. e.g. global.nativeTest.foo will call this method with PropNameID === \"foo\".\nPart 1.2 - The C++ Binding's install\nNow that we've defined our HostObject, we need to install it into the runtime. We use a static member function that we'll call later to set this up. It looks like this:\nvoid TestBinding::install(jsi::Runtime &amp;runtime,\n                          std::shared_ptr&lt;TestBinding&gt; testBinding) {\n  // What is the name that js will use when it reaches for this?\n  // i.e. `global.nativeTest` in JS\n  auto testModuleName = \"nativeTest\";\n  // Create a JS object version of our binding\n  auto object = jsi::Object::createFromHostObject(runtime, testBinding);\n  // set the \"nativeTest\" propert\n  runtime.global().setProperty(runtime, testModuleName, std::move(object));\n}\nPart 2. Installing the binding (on Android)\nSince we have a reference to the runtime in Java land, we'll have to create a JNI method to pass the runtime ptr to the native C++ land. We can add this JNI method to our TestBinding file with a guard.\n#if ANDROID\nextern \"C\" {\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_com_testmodule_MainActivity_install(\n    JNIEnv *env, jobject thiz, jlong runtimePtr) {\n  auto testBinding = std::make_shared&lt;example::TestBinding&gt;();\n  jsi::Runtime *runtime = (jsi::Runtime *)runtimePtr;\nexample::TestBinding::install(*runtime, testBinding);\n}\n}\n#endif\n\nThen on the Java side (after we compile this into a shared library), we register this native function and call it when we're ready.\n// In MainActivity\npublic class MainActivity extends ReactActivity implements ReactInstanceManager.ReactInstanceEventListener {\nstatic {\n// Load our jni\nSystem.loadLibrary(\"test_module_jni\");\n}\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;//... ellided ...\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;@&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;Override\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;public void &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#8fa1b3;\"&gt;onReactContextInitialized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#ebcb8b;\"&gt;ReactContext &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;) {\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;// Call our native function with the runtime pointer\n    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;(context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;getJavaScriptContextHolder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;().&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;());\n}\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#65737e;\"&gt;//  declare our native function\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;public native void &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#8fa1b3;\"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#b48ead;\"&gt;long &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#bf616a;\"&gt;jsContextNativePointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"color:#eff1f5;\"&gt;);\n\n}\nPart 3. Calling Go\nNow that our binding is installed in the runtime, we can make it do something useful.\njsi::Value TestBinding::get(jsi::Runtime &amp;runtime,\n                            const jsi::PropNameID &amp;name) {\n  auto methodName = name.utf8(runtime);\nif (methodName == \"runTest\") {\nreturn jsi::Function::createFromHostFunction(\nruntime, name, 0,\n[](jsi::Runtime &amp;runtime, const jsi::Value &amp;thisValue,\nconst jsi::Value *arguments,\nsize_t count) -&gt; jsi::Value { return TestNum(); });\n}\nreturn jsi::Value::undefined();\n}\n\nHere we return a jsi::Function when JS calls global.nativeTest.runTest. When JS calls it (as in global.nativeTest.runTest()) we execute the code inside the closure, which just returns TestNum(). TestNum is a Go function that's exported through cgo so that it is available to c/c++. Our Go code looks like this:\npackage main\nimport \"C\"\n// TestNum returns a test number to be used in JSI\n//export TestNum\nfunc TestNum() int {\nreturn int(9001)\n}\nfunc main() {\n}\n\ncgo builds a header and creates a shared library that is used by our binding.\nBuilding\n\nLook at the CMakeLists.txt for specifics on building the C++ code.\nLook at from-go/build.sh for specifics on building the go code.\n\nA Go Shared Library for C + Java\nIt's possible to build the Go code as a shared library for both C and Java, but you'll have to define your own JNI methods. It would be nice if gomobile bind also generated C headers for android, but it doesn't seem possible right now. Instead you'll have to run go build -buildmode=c-shared directly and define your jni methods yourself. Take a look at from-go/build.sh and testnum.go for specifics.\nFurther Reading\nJSI Challenge #1\nJSI Challenge #2\nRN Glossary of Terms\nGO JNI\nGO Cross Compilation\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-interacting-with-go-from-react-native-through-jsi/","title":"Interacting with Go from React Native through JSI"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-my-experience-at-the-recurse-center/":{"body":"The Recurse Center is this magical place where hours fly by, and you can be as distracted or as focused as you choose to be. It's composed of two nice floors of a building in downtown Brooklyn. They provide a space where you can progress on your own programming specific goals at your own self direction.\nSome of my best friends are RCers. All of them really enjoyed their time at RC, and would recommend it to anyone who would listen. With glowing praise from people I deeply respect, how could I not give it a try? It also helped that I had a friend and former co-worker (Fred) applying for a week long batch as well.\nInitially I was skeptical about it. It also seemed like quite a bit of work. I spent days on their \"What do you want to be doing in 2 years question\"; I'd have to do two interviews; and I'd have to figure out living logistics. Given those hurdles I was skeptical of what the benefit of the program would be. Despite my skepticism I decided to trust my friends. Well... Truthfully Fred nudged me along, and I'm very glad he did.\nThe Mini Batch. (1 Week long program)\nThe mini batch seems like a strategy to bring in folks who cannot be in NYC for 6 or 12 weeks or are not ready for that level of commitment (That's me!). It felt much shorter than I was expecting (and I was expecting it to be short). Every day of the week puts you 20% closer to the end of the program! After seeing how fast a week goes by, 6 and 12 weeks don't seem so long.\nWhat's special about The Recurse Center\nThe project I worked on is something I've been toying with in my mind for a while. I even wrote a couple toy implementations that never got fleshed out. I've been toying with the idea for at least 4 months, and hadn't made much progress. After a week at RC, however, starting from scratch, I'd already gotten much farther than ever before. I believe it was a combination of a couple things at RC.\n\nYou can spend your time programming on your own projects (and people will think that's neat)\n\nContrast this with most places where the external pressures ask:\n\nAt home: \"What are you doing that for? Is it for work? Oh, It isn't? Okay.\"\nOn Vacation: \"Why are you on your computer when you could be outside exploring?\"\nHackathon: \"What are you working on? How is going to make us two boat loads of money?\"\n\n\n\n\nA social space and quiet space.\n\nThe Recurse Center has two floors. A quiet floor (imagine a less strict library) and an active/social floor (where people talk freely, express freely, and openly invite each other to pair program something with them.). I think this is really important and, thinking back to previous jobs, I think it would be a great addition to any company with enough programmers. Sometimes I want to talk to people, and be interrupted, and pair with someone; but sometimes I just want to sit down, uninterrupted, and get lost in my problem space and thoughts.\n\n\nDiversity.\n\nThe diversity in the people who attend.\n\nBeing at RC lets me preview a world where our industry is more inclusive and diverse.\nPeople with different backgrounds bring different thoughts and potential solutions.\nA monoculture of ideas is a recipe for stagnation. Team work objectively leads to better solutions.\n\n\nThe diversity in the knowledge backgrounds.\n\nQuick example: Imagine you want to know how VGA character buffers work, you can find someone who spent at least a week studying it in a matter of minutes.\nYou can get pleasantly side-tracked with someone else's rabbit hole.\nYou can explore the limits of your knowledge when explaining things you thought you understood to people who are genuinely curious!\n\n\n\n\nNot a startup incubator\n\nI used to go to hackathons because I liked the idea of building something fun with friends. I stopped going because it turned into a competition to see which one of these 48 hour projects can become the next unicorn startup. (Incidentally, Brian and I started our own hackathon we call the Dumbathon which tries to find the original spirit of the hackathon.)\nAt RC, no one ever asks \"How are you going to make money off this?\" If all you end up after your batch is a deeper understanding of problems that interest you, then you've had a successful time there and no one will tell you differently.\n\n\nLightweight Social Rules.\n\nInteracting with a lot of new people is hard. RC has 4 lightweight social rules to help people be nice to each other. On top of that, there's an understanding that everyone here is clever and everyone is here because they truly want to be here. That level of commitment isn't common in most interactions. The combination of those two things make it a joy to interact with other RCers in the space and get lost talking about your programming project or hearing about their recent problems.\n\n\n\nWhy I think you should do it\nIt may seem selfish or purely indulgent to take away time from your life to go to a programmer's retreat, it isn't. Take history's most selfless person, The Buddha. He dedicated his life to reducing the suffering of those around him. One lesser know story about The Buddha is that he would have 3 month retreats yearly where he and his disciples could refocus and reinvest their energies. I tell this anecdote not to liken us to The Buddha, but to point out that the prototypical selfless person found these retreats useful.\nI think in the daily grind it's easy to loose sight of the things that matter to you. Often when at a normal job, your goals of growth and learning don't align with the bottom line of the business. That's okay, but it's very nice to be able to step back and re-hone your tool set.\n\nMy Project\nIn a week, I built an Android UI Library for Rust. I am proud of it, and I'll have another post that details it at length.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-my-experience-at-the-recurse-center/","title":"My Experience at The Recurse Center"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-nix-and-small-containers-with-docker-multi-stage-builds/":{"body":"Multi Stage builds are great for minimizing the size of your container. The\ngeneral idea is you have a stage as your builder and another stage as your\nproduct. This allows you to have a full development and build container while\nstill having a lean production container. The production container only carries\nits runtime dependencies.\nFROM golang:1.7.3\nWORKDIR /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/\nRUN go get -d -v golang.org/x/net/html\nCOPY app.go .\nRUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -installsuffix cgo -o app .\nFROM alpine:latest\nRUN apk --no-cache add ca-certificates\nWORKDIR /root/\nCOPY --from=0 /go/src/github.com/alexellis/href-counter/app .\nCMD [\"./app\"]\n\n(from Docker's docs on multi-stage)\nSounds great, right? What's the catch? Well, it's not always easy to know what the\nruntime dependencies are. For example you may have installed something in /lib\nthat was needed in the build process. But it turned out to be a shared library\nand now it needs to be included in the production container. Tricky! Is there\nsome automated way to know all your runtime dependencies?\nEnter Nix\nNix is a functional and immutable package manager. It works great for\nreproducible builds. It keeps track of packages and their dependencies via their\ncontent hashes. And, relevant for this exercise, it also keeps track of the\ndependencies of a built package. That means we can use Nix to build our project\nand then ask Nix what our runtime dependencies are. With that information we can\ncopy just those files to the product stage of our multi-stage build and end up\nwith the smallest possible docker container.\nOur general strategy will be to use a Nix builder to build our code. Ask the Nix\nbuilder to tell us all the runtime dependencies of our built executable. Then\ncopy the executable with all it's runtime dependencies to a fresh container. Our\nexpectation is that this will result in a minimal production container.\nExample\nAs a simple example let's package a \"Hello World\" program in Rust. The code is\nwhat you'd expect:\npub fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\nNix build expression\nIf we were just building this locally, we'd just run cargo build --release.\nBut we are going to have Nix build this for us so that it can track the runtime\ndependencies. Therefore we need a default.nix file to describe the build\nprocess. Our default.nix build file looks like this:\nwith (import &lt;nixpkgs&gt; {});\nrustPlatform.buildRustPackage {\n  name = \"hello-rust\";\n  buildInputs = [ cargo rustc ];\n  src = ./.;\n  # This is a shasum over our crate dependencies\n  cargoSha256 = \"1s4vg081ci6hskb3kk965nxnx384w8xb7n7yc4g93hj55qsk4vw5\";\n  # Use this to figure out the correct Sha256\n  # cargoSha256 = lib.fakeSha256;\n  buildPhase = ''\n    cargo build --release\n  '';\n  checkPhase = \"\";\n  installPhase = ''\n    mkdir -p $out/bin\n    cp target/release/hello $out/bin\n  '';\n}\n\nBreaking down the Nix expression: we specify what our inputs our to our\nbuild: cargo and rustc; we figure out what the sha256sum is of our crate\ndependencies; and we define some commands to build and install the executable.\nWe can verify this works locally on our machine by running nix-build .\n(assuming you have Nix installed locally). You'll end up with a symlink named\nresult that points the compiled executable residing in /nix/store. Running\n./result/bin/hello should print \"Hello, world!\".\nDocker file\nNow that we've built our Nix expression that defines how the code is built, we\ncan add Docker to the mix. The goal is to have a builder stage that runs the\nnix-build command, then have a production stage that copies the executable and\nits runtime dependencies from builder. The production stage container will\ntherefore have only the minimal amount of stuff needed to run.\n# Use nix as the builder\nFROM nixos/nix:latest AS builder\n# Update the channel so we can get the latest packages\nRUN nix-channel --update nixpkgs\n\nWORKDIR /app\n# Run the builder first without our code to fetch build dependencies.\nThis will fail, but that's okay. We just want to have the build dependencies \n\ncached as a layer. This is just a caching optimization that can be removed. \n\nCOPY default.nix .\nRUN nix-build . || true\nCOPY . .\n# Now that our code is here we actually build it\nRUN nix-build .\n# Copy all the run time dependencies into /tmp/nix-store-closure\nRUN mkdir /tmp/nix-store-closure\nRUN echo \"Output references (Runtime dependencies):\" $(nix-store -qR result/)\nRUN cp -R $(nix-store -qR result/) /tmp/nix-store-closure\nENTRYPOINT [ \"/bin/sh\" ]\n# Our production stage\nFROM scratch\nWORKDIR /app\n# Copy the runtime dependencies into /nix/store\nNote we don't actually have nix installed on this container. But that's fine, \n\nwe don't need it, the built code only relies on the given files existing, not \n\nNix. \n\nCOPY --from=builder /tmp/nix-store-closure /nix/store\nCOPY --from=builder /app/result /app\nCMD [\"/app/bin/hello\"]\n\nIf we build this Dockerfile with docker build ., we'll end up with an 33MB\ncontainer. Compare this to a naive\nDockerfile\nwhere we end up with a 624 MB container! That's an order of magnitude smaller\nfor a relatively simple change.\nNote that our executable has a shared library dependency on libc. Alpine\nlinux doesn't include libc, but this still works. How? When we build our code we\nreference the libc shared library stored inside /nix/store. Then when we copy\nthe executable nix tells us that the libc shared library is also a dependency so\nwe copy that too. Our executable uses only the libc inside /nix/store and\ndoesn't rely on any system provided libraries in /lib or elsewhere.\nConclusion\nWith a simple Nix build expression and the use of Docker's multi stage builds we\ncan use Docker's strength of providing a consistent and portable environment\nwith Nix's fine grained dependency resolution to create a minimal production\ncontainer.\nA note on statically linked executables\nYes, you could build the hello world example as a statically linked musl-backed\nbinary. But that's not the point. Sometimes code relies on a shared library, and\nit's just not worth or impossible to convert it. The beauty of this system is\nthat it doesn't matter if the output executable is fully statically linked or\nnot. It will work just the same and copy over the minimum amount of code needed\nfor the production container to work.\nA note on Nix's dockerTools\nNix proves a set of functions for creating Docker images:\npkgs.dockerTools. It's\nvery cool, and I recommend checking it. Unlike docker it produces\ndeterministic images. Note, for all but the simplest examples, KVM is required.\nA note on Bazel's rules_docker\nI don't know much about this, but I'd assume this would be similar to what I've\ndescribed. If you know more about this, please let me know!\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-nix-and-small-containers-with-docker-multi-stage-builds/","title":"Nix and small containers with Docker multi-stage builds"},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-simple-declarative-vms/":{"body":"I've been on a hunt to find a simple and declarative way to define VMs. I wanted\nsomething like NixOS\nContainers, but with a\nstronger security guarantee. I wanted to be able to use a Nix expression to\ndefine what the VM should look like, then reference that on my Server's\nexpression and have it all work automatically. I didn't want to manually\nrun any commands. The hunt is over, I finally found it.\nMy Use Case\nI want a machine that I can permanently hook up to a WireGuard VPN and treat\nas if it were in a remote place. At first I did this with a physical machine,\nbut I didn't want to commit the whole machine's compute for a novelty. What I\nreally want is a small VM that is permanently hooked up to a WireGuard VPN.\nMinimal investment with all the upsides.\nNixOS QEMU\nNix OS supports building your system in a QEMU runnable environment right out of\nthe box. nixos-rebuild build-vm is a wrapper over nix build github:marcopolo/marcopolo.github.io#nixosConfigurations.small-vm.config.system.build.vm. (Side note, with\nflakes you can build this exact VM by running that command1). This means NixOS\nalready did the hard work of turning a NixOS configuration into a valid VM that\ncan be launched with QEMU. Not only that, but the VM shares the /nix/store\nwith the host. This results in a really small VM (disk size is 5MB).\nNixOS does the heavy lifting of converting a configuration into a script that\nwill run a VM, so all I need to do is write a service that manages this process.\nEnter simple-vms, heavily inspired by\nvms.nix and\nnixos-shell. simple-vms is a NixOS\nmodule that takes in a reference to the\nnixosConfigurations.small-vm.config.system.build.vm derivation and the\noption of whether you want state to be persisted, and defines a Systemd\nservice for the vm (There can be multiple VMs). This really is a simple\nmodule, the NixOS service definition is about 10 lines long, and its\nExecStart is simply:\nmkdir -p /var/lib/simple-vms/${name}\ncd /var/lib/simple-vms/${name}\nexec ${cfg.vm.out}/bin/run-nixos-vm;\n\nWith this service we can get and keep our VMs up and running.\nStateless VMs\nI got a sticker recently that said \"You either have one source of truth, of\nmultiple sources of lies.\" To that end, I wanted to make my VM completely\nstateless. QEMU lets you mount folders into the VM, so I used that to mount host\nfolders in the VM's /etc/wireguard and /etc/ssh so that the host can\nprovide the VM with WireGuard keys, and the VM can persist it's SSH host keys.\nThat's all the VM really needs. Every time my VM shuts down I delete the drive.\nAnd just to be safe, I try deleting any drive on boot too.\nIf you're running a service on the VM, you'll likely want to persist that\nservice's state files too in a similar way.\nFin\nThat's it. Just a small post for a neat little trick. If you set this up let\nme know! I'm interested in hearing your use case.\nFootnotes\n1\nUser/pass = root/root.

I don't disagree that it has done some amazing things\n\"Compiled output results in smaller apps\"\n\nE.g. Svelte apps start smaller but the compiler output is 3-4x larger per component than the equivalent VDOM approach.\n\nThis may be true currently, but that doesn't mean it will always be true of compiled-to frameworks. A theoretical compiler can produce a component that uses a shared library for all components. If a user doesn't use all the features of a framework, then a compiler could remove the unused features from the output. Which is something that could not happen with a framework that relies on a full runtime.\nNote: I'm not advocating for a compiled-to approach, I just think this point was misleading\n\"DOM is stateful/imperative, so we should embrace it\"\nI agree with OP here. Most use-cases would not benefit from an imperative UI api.\n\"React leaks implementation details through useMemo\"\nA common problem to bite new comers is when they pass a closure to a component, and that closure gets changed every time which causes their component to re-render every time. useMemo can fix this issue, but it offloads a bit of work to the developer.\nIn the above context, it's an implementation detail. I'm not saying it's the wrong or right trade off, I'm only saying that the reason you have to reach for useMemo when passing around closures is because of how React is implemented. So the quote is accurate.\nIs that a bad thing? That's where it gets more subjective. I think it is, because these types of things happen very often and, in a big app, you quickly succumb to death by a thousand cuts (one closure causing a component to re-render isn't a big deal, but when you have hundreds of components with various closures it gets hairy).\nThe next example OP posts is about setting users in a list.\nsetUsers([\n  ...users.filter(user =&gt; user.name !== \"Sebastian\"),\n  { name: \"Sebastian\" }\n]);\n\nIf you are happy with that syntax, and the tradeoff of having to use key props whenever you display lists, and relying on React's heuristics to efficiently update the views corresponding to the list, then React is fine. If, however, you are okay with a different syntax you may be interested in another idea I've seen. The basic idea is you keep track of the diffs themselves instead of the old version vs. the new version. Knowing the diffs directly let you know exactly how to update the views directly so you don't have to rely on the key prop, heuristics, and you can efficiently/quickly update the View list. This is similar to how Immer works. Futures Signals also does this to efficiently send updates of a list to consumers (look at SignalVec).\n\"Stale closures in Hooks are confusing\"\nI agree with OP's points here. It's important to know where your data is coming from. In the old hook-less style of React, your data was what you got from your props/state and nothing else. With hooks, it's easier to work with stale data that comes in from outside your props. It's a learning curve, but not necessarily bad.\nOne thing I find interesting is that the use of hooks moves functional components into becoming more stateful components. I think this is fine, but it loses the pure functional guarantees you had before.\nI haven't yet made up my mind about hooks that interact with the context. (i.e. useSelector or useDispatch) since the context is less structured. i.e. This component's selector function for useSelector relies on the state being X, but X isn't passed in, it's set as the store in redux configuration file somewhere else. Now that the component relies on the shape of the store being X it makes it harder to move out. This may not actually matter in practice, and it may be much more useful to be able to pull arbitrary things out of your store. Hence why I'm currently undecided about it.\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-thoughts-on-why-is-react-doing-this/","title":"Thoughts on \"Why is React doing this?\""},"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-wasm-is-the-future-of-serverless-terrafirma-serverless-wasm-functions/":{"body":"When I ran into Fastly's Terrarium, the appeal of Webassembly (wasm) finally clicked for me. We could have lightweight sandboxes and bring in my own language and libraries without the overhead of a full OS VM or Docker. That's great for the serverless provider, but it's also great for the end user. Less overhead means faster startup time and less total cost.\nHow much faster?\nOn my machine™, a hello world shell script takes 3ms, a docker equivalent takes 700ms, and a wasm equivalent takes 15ms.\nFollowing this experiment I get these results:\nRunning: ./hello.sh\navg: 3.516431ms\nRunning: docker run treeder/hello:sh\navg: 692.306769ms\nRunning: docker run --rm treeder/hello:sh\navg: 725.912422ms\nRunning: docker start -a reuse\navg: 655.059021ms\nRunning: node hello.js\navg: 79.233337ms\nRunning: wasmer run wasi-hello-world.wasm\navg: 15.155896ms\n\nWhen I think about how WASM, Docker, and OS VMs (compute instances) play together, I picture this graph below.\n\nThe trend is that if you want safety and isolation, you must pay for it with overhead. WASM's exception to that rule is what I think makes it so promising and interesting. Wasm provides the fastest way to run arbitrary user code in a sandboxed environment.\nWhat is Webassembly?\nWebassembly is a spec for a lightweight and sandboxed VM. Webassembly is run by a host, and can't do any side effects, unless it calls a function provided by the host. For example, if your WASM code wanted to make a GET request to a website, it could only do that by asking the host to help. The host exposes these helper function to the WASM guest. In Terrafirma, these are the hostcall_* functions in imports.go. It's called imports.go because it is what your WASM code is importing from the host.\nBring your own tools\nAs long as you can compile everything to a .wasm file, you can use whatever tools and language you want. All I have to do is provide a runtime, and all you have to do is provide a wasm file. However, there is a subtle caveat here. The only way you can run side effects is with the host cooperation. So you (or some library you use) must understand the environment you're running in in order to do anything interesting.\nWhat about a standard WASM Environment?\nThere isn't a mature industry standard for what imports a host should provide to the WASM code running outside the browser. The closest thing we have is WASI, which defines a POSIX inspired set of syscalls that a host should implement. It's useful because it allows code would otherwise require a real syscall to work in a WASM environment. For example, In Rust you can build with the --target wasm32-wasi flag and your code will just work in any wasi environment.\nTerrafirma\nPhew! Finally at TerraFirma. TerraFirma is a WASM runtime environment I wrote to let you run wasm code in the cloud. You upload your wasm file by copying it into a shared KBFS folder with the keybase user kbwasm. Then you setup some DNS records to point your domain to TerraFirma's servers. And that's it! You can update the wasm code at any time by overwriting the old .wasm file with the new one.\nCode Examples\n\nHello World\nScraper Endpoint – A web scraper that uses Servo – a new browser engine from Mozilla.\n\nTerrafirma – Hello World Tutorial\nThis example uses Rust, so if you don't have that setup go here first.\n\nPoint your domain to TerraFirma servers (terrafirma.marcopolo.io or 52.53.126.109) with an A record, and set a TXT record to point to your shared folder (e.g. \"kbp=/keybase/private/&lt;my_keybase_username&gt;,kbwasm/\")\n\n\nexample.com 300 A terrafirma.marcopolo.io\n_keybase_pages.example.com 300 TXT \"kbp=/keybase/private/&lt;my_keybase_username&gt;,kbwasm/\"\n\n\nVerify the DNS records are correct\n\n\n$ dig example.com A\n...\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\nwasm.marcopolo.io.      300     IN      A       52.53.126.109\n...\n\n\n$ dig _keybase_pages.example.com TXT\n...\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\n_keybase_pages.example.com &lt;number&gt; IN TXT \"kbp=/keybase/private/&lt;my_keybase_username&gt;,kbpbot/\"\n...\n\n\n\nClone the Hello World Repo\n\ngit clone git@github.com:MarcoPolo/terrafirma-hello-world.git\n\n\nBuild it\n\ncd terrafirma-hello-world\ncargo build --release\n\n\nDeploy it\n\n\ncp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/terrafirma_helloworld.wasm /keybase/private/&lt;your_kb_username&gt;,kbwasm/hello.wasm\n\n\nTest it\n\ncurl https://example.com/hello.wasm\n\n","id":"https://blog.cryptic.io/marco-wasm-is-the-future-of-serverless-terrafirma-serverless-wasm-functions/","title":"Wasm is the future of serverless.
